1
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:27,654
(eerie music playing)

2
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,939
(instrumental music playing)

3
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,127
(thunder rumbling)

4
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:17,448
Will they come?

5
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,150
They'll come.

6
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:23,386
Here. Stamp those
and mail them.

7
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:04,326
It's ringing.

8
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:05,994
Please walk myron
over there.

9
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:09,564
My leg looks like
a tree in this fog.

10
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:15,502
What a godforsaken
spot to get lost.

11
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:18,204
We passed
a better spot.

12
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:21,774
(telephone ringing)

13
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:32,451
Hello?

14
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:34,753
Hello?
Hello?

15
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,622
Tell them
we're lost.

16
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:39,991
(ringing continues)

17
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:46,864
Nobody answered,
the phone went dead.

18
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:47,731
Then why did you
say hello?

19
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:50,100
Funny, i could
have sworn...
What, dickie?

20
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:52,102
Sounded like somebody
snipped the wire.

21
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:56,072
Really?
What did it
sound like?

22
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,541
Snip.

23
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:05,213
Willie:
Some fog, eh, pop?

24
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:09,550
Wang: I've heard
the weather report.
Drive, please.

25
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:11,818
It's as thick
as pea soup.

26
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,986
Not a soul
around for miles.

27
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:17,222
Know what l think?
Perfect place for
a murder.

28
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:22,527
Conversation like
television set
on honeymoon.

29
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:23,961
Unnecessary.

30
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:49,819
(door creaking)

31
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:00,963
Willie: Where are
we going?

32
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:03,298
Who is mr. Twain?

33
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,133
What did he mean by
"dinner and a murder"?

34
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:08,536
Questions like
athlete's foot.

35
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:12,573
After while,
very irritating.

36
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,507
(dog barking)

37
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:15,608
To stop car,
please.

38
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,110
What's wrong?
Stop car, please.

39
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:19,978
(dog howling)

40
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:24,281
To shut engine
off, please.

41
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,082
Listen.

42
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,884
I don't hear nothing.
What do you hear?

43
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:32,419
Double negative
and dog.

44
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:34,220
So what?

45
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:35,321
If not mistaken,

46
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:38,223
Dog belong to
mr. Dick charleston.

47
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,324
Who is
dick charleston?

48
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:43,594
I am. Thank you.
Did you see
a little white...

49
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:46,028
Wang.
A white wang?

50
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,296
Good heavens.
Sidney wang.

51
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:50,264
What are you
doing here?

52
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,698
No doubt
same as you.

53
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,203
Looking for
bridge to home of
mr. Lionel twain.

54
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:57,703
You too, huh?

55
00:07:57,705 --> 00:08:00,305
Must be important
to invite two such
eminent detectives.

56
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:05,543
Excuse, please.
To introduce
japanese son, willie.

57
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:05,976
Hi.

58
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:07,410
Japanese?
But i thought...

59
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:09,945
Mrs. Wang and i
never had children.

60
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,480
Willie adopted
number three son.

61
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:15,316
Be careful
on this road.
It's treacherous.

62
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:18,952
Treacherous road
like fresh mushroom...

63
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:20,319
Idiot.

64
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:22,921
Not finish
mushroom story.

65
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:25,023
You're idiot.

66
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:26,624
(scoffs)

67
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:33,997
<i>I'm sorry,
monsieur perrier,
but i can see nothing.</i>

68
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:36,666
This fog is thick
as bouillabaisse.

69
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:37,533
Nuts.

70
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:39,635
Pardon?
Nuts. Nuts.

71
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:41,770
No nuts
in my chocolate.

72
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,440
You got raisins.
I asked for nuts.

73
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,443
He didn't have
any nuts.

74
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,510
The man
in the shop?

75
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:52,612
That's why
i took raisins.

76
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:54,614
Never mind.

77
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:57,917
We will soon
be there for dinner.
Hot soup.

78
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,318
<i>Still,  monsieur,</i>

79
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,253
Something is
not right here.

80
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:04,089
I can feel it
in my bones.

81
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,023
In your what?

82
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,958
In my bones.

83
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:10,493
Buns?
You have buns?

84
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:13,162
You bought buns
and didn't tell me?

85
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:14,463
Where are they?

86
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:17,632
<i>No,  monsieur.
The bones in my body.</i>

87
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:21,669
Don't speak
with an accent
when i'm hungry.

88
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:33,580
Sam,
this is useless.

89
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:34,781
Nobody asked
you, baby.

90
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:38,985
Yes, they did.
You asked me
back there if...

91
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:40,286
That was then,
this is now,

92
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,622
And nobody knows
what tomorrow
will be.

93
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,825
That's the way
things are.

94
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:50,228
Sam, i really
worry about you
sometimes.

95
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,195
All right.
Cut the malarkey.

96
00:09:51,197 --> 00:09:53,564
This trip is strictly
business with me.

97
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:55,499
What do you got
on this twain guy?

98
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,501
He was born
in san francisco
in 1906.

99
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,371
Mother was a roman catholic.
Father was an orthodox jew.

100
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:04,173
The marriage
lasted two hours.

101
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:04,873
Any children?

102
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:09,711
One daughter, 32,
irene, who calls
herself rita.

103
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,212
Just like a dame.

104
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:13,047
Don't stop.
You're doing fine.

105
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:18,252
Arrested in 1932 for
selling pornographic bibles.

106
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:19,186
Charges were dropped

107
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,555
When the church
refused to turn
over the bibles.

108
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:26,092
In '46,
he was picked up
in el paso, texas,

109
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:29,762
For smuggling a truckload
of rich white americans

110
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:32,297
Into mexico
to pick melons.

111
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,768
He was sent
to the dallas state hospital
for mental observation.

112
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,104
We've picked ourselves
a queer bird.

113
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,438
Anything else?

114
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,372
Oh, yeah.
Get this, sam.

115
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:47,043
Lionel twain has one
interesting physical
characteristic.

116
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:49,211
He has no pinkies.

117
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:51,212
No pinkies?

118
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:52,913
He only has
eight fingers?

119
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:57,851
No, 10.
He just doesn't
have any pinkies.

120
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,285
Good work,
angel.

121
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:02,421
Thanks, sam.
Where'd you
dig up that stuff?

122
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,423
I wrote to twain
and asked him.

123
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:06,425
Good thinking.

124
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:08,793
(engine sputtering)

125
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:10,194
What's the matter?

126
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:13,297
Wouldn't you know?
Out of gas.

127
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:18,734
I saw a station
about 5 miles back, sam.

128
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:23,004
I want you to know
i'll be waiting
for you.

129
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:38,519
Willie:
The bridge
doesn't look safe.

130
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:40,487
One way to find out.

131
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:41,554
Drive across.

132
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:43,956
Aren't you
coming with me?

133
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,559
Weight of two men
may be too much.

134
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:48,660
Why do i
have to drive?

135
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:53,297
(bridge creaking)
because i smart enough
to get out first.

136
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,343
(creaking continues)

137
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:10,813
It's going to
collapse, pop.

138
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:15,484
Not worry.
Father find other
way to house.

139
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,630
I made it, pop.
I made it.

140
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:34,335
Good. Now come
back and get
adopted father.

141
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,438
Look at invitation.

142
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,273
What number of house?

143
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:41,540
Two, two...

144
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:44,175
Correct.
22, twain's house.

145
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,943
Continue.

146
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:13,469
Did you see that?
No.

147
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:15,270
Neither did i.

148
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:24,812
Stop.
Do not move.

149
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,546
Something's
wrong here.

150
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:29,582
What is it, pop?
Do not ask
questions.

151
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:30,115
Do as i say.

152
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:33,618
When i tell you jump,
you jump.

153
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,452
Five,

154
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:37,288
Four, three, two...

155
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,558
Holy shanghai!

156
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:45,428
Nice counting, pop.
How did you know?

157
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,496
Look on ground.

158
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:51,733
Ha! Even had
correct shoe size.

159
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,367
Someone gone
great trouble

160
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:57,237
To make welcome guest
not so welcome.

161
00:13:58,106 --> 00:13:59,371
Ring bell, please.

162
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:02,307
Are you nuts, pop?
Someone's trying
to kill us.

163
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:06,110
Yes. Should make
exciting weekend.

164
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,578
Ring, please.

165
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,614
I wish it was
monday morning.

166
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,950
Well, here goes.

167
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,985
(woman screaming)

168
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:18,320
Holy cow.
They're killing someone.

169
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:20,922
Calm yourself.
Didn't you
hear her scream?

170
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:23,024
No.
You heard scream.

171
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:26,827
More experienced ear
heard doorbell.

172
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:28,862
Listen again.

173
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:31,631
(woman screaming)

174
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:37,802
Mr. Twain has macabre
sense of humor, yes?

175
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,737
(thunder rumbling)

176
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,992
Good evening.
We have been
expecting you.

177
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:04,560
But in what condition?

178
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:07,596
Roof in need
of repair.

179
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:11,232
I'm afraid the house
is falling apart.

180
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:13,867
May we come in,
please?

181
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:16,903
I'm so sorry.
I thought you were in.

182
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:20,773
You are mr. And
mrs. Charleston?

183
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:21,973
Not quite.

184
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:25,710
I am inspector wang
of catalina police.

185
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:28,512
This adopted son,
willie.

186
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:32,782
I trust you had
a pleasant journey.

187
00:15:44,762 --> 00:15:49,598
Strange weather.
Storm only outside,

188
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,433
Wind inside.

189
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:54,969
That's just
one of mr. Twain's
little toys,

190
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:56,603
An electronic device.

191
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:59,405
Mr. Twain, as you
will soon discover,

192
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:02,508
Prefers his
atmosphere murky.

193
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,376
May i have
your bags, sir?

194
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:07,078
No. Son
will get bags.

195
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,413
That is why
i adopted him.

196
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:10,380
Very good, sir.

197
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:12,148
One moment, please,

198
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,683
While i close the door.

199
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,989
Now,
i will show you
to your room.

200
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,168
Very large house.

201
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,068
No other servants?

202
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,538
I'm not sure.
I've never seen
anyone.

203
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,578
Mr. Twain asked me to
make you comfortable.

204
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,747
He will be joining
you after dinner.

205
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:50,681
After dinner?

206
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:53,383
Host not have dinner
with guests?

207
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:57,820
No. Mr. Twain
prefers to eat out.

208
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:10,198
(barking)

209
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,467
Wait, please.
What that?

210
00:17:13,469 --> 00:17:15,836
It's nothing, sir.
Just the cat.

211
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,205
(barking continues)

212
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:19,673
That cat?

213
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:22,776
You feed cat
dog food?

214
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:25,145
He's a very angry cat.

215
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:27,647
Mr. Twain
had him fixed,

216
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:29,749
And he didn't
want to be.

217
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,317
(growls)

218
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,251
Big house,
huh, pop?

219
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:37,154
Big house
like man married
to fat woman.

220
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,489
Hard to
get around.

221
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,424
Here we are.

222
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:44,059
I'm sure you'll
find this suitable.

223
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:45,260
Boy, it's
a cold house.

224
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:46,361
I've taken care
of that, sir.

225
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:50,898
You'll find
a nice, cozy fire
in your room, sir.

226
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,450
It's a bit smoky, sir.

227
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:14,287
That fireplace hasn't
been used in years.

228
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:16,022
At least
the bed is warm.

229
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:19,558
If you wish
anything, sir,
please ring.

230
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,525
Where buzzer?

231
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:23,961
It's behind
the bed, sir. There.

232
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:25,095
Dinner will
be at 9:00,

233
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:29,499
And mr. Twain
likes his guests
to dress.

234
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:31,701
(woman screaming)

235
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:34,570
The doorbell.
Excuse me.

236
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:39,307
Wow. What a creepy guy.

237
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:41,475
Why would anyone
hire a blind butler?

238
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:43,910
For one thing,
very cheap.

239
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:47,580
How butler know
how much he get paid?

240
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:53,418
Drink this.
You'll feel better.

241
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,419
If myron
hadn't barked,

242
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:56,754
We wouldn't have
seen that statue falling.

243
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:59,523
It wasn't meant to kill.
It's a warning.

244
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:01,391
Somebody's just
trying to frighten us,
but why?

245
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:04,193
He's doing
a wonderful job.

246
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:05,527
Why hasn't
anybody answered?

247
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:08,930
Don't ring it
again, dickie.
Knock, don't ring.

248
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:10,831
I won't. I promise.

249
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,033
(thunder rumbling)

250
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:17,403
(growling)

251
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:19,537
What is it now,
myron?

252
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,206
Up there, dora.
Look.

253
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:23,840
A blind butler.

254
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:27,376
Don't let him
park the car,
dickie.

255
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:36,917
Good evening.
We have been
expecting you.

256
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,251
We let
ourselves in.

257
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:39,452
Dick and
dora charleston.

258
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:43,355
Good evening.
We have been
expecting you.

259
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:45,689
Your room is ready.

260
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:47,624
Just follow me, please.

261
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,092
(growls)

262
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:52,628
Never mind, ma'am.
It's just the cat.

263
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,565
Our luggage
is outside.

264
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,502
I'll get it
when i park the car.

265
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,973
Is mr. Wang here?
Yes.

266
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:08,908
They're resting
in their room.

267
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,811
I put you
in the same wing
as mr. Wang.

268
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:16,447
Isn't that nice?
We're in wang's wing.

269
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,190
Not many people come
to the manor these days.

270
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,659
It's nice to
hear guests again.

271
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,927
Thank you.
You are?
Bensonmum.

272
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:32,694
Thank you,
benson.

273
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:36,564
No. My name
is bensonmum.

274
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,532
Bensonmum?
Yes, sir.

275
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:40,567
Jamesir bensonmum.

276
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:41,034
Jamesir?

277
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:43,536
Yes, sir.
Jamesir
bensonmum?

278
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:45,170
Yes, sir.
How odd.

279
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:48,606
My father's
name, sir.
What?

280
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:50,541
Howard bensonmum.

281
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:52,342
Your father was
howard bensonmum?

282
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:53,710
Leave it be,
dickie.

283
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,647
Here is the late
mrs. Twain's room.

284
00:20:57,649 --> 00:20:59,982
She died in here.

285
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:00,949
Oh, dear.

286
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:01,516
Died of what?

287
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:04,819
She murdered herself
in her sleep, sir.

288
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:05,753
You mean suicide?

289
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:09,289
No, it was murder
all right.

290
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,258
Mrs. Twain hated herself.

291
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,127
We keep this room locked.

292
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:15,961
Why is that?

293
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:18,363
Mr. Twain loved her
very much.

294
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:20,465
He's kept her room
just as it was

295
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:23,367
The night
she choked herself,

296
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,502
Nine years ago.

297
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:28,337
(door creaking)

298
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:35,944
Madam loved
it here.

299
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:39,981
She said
it was such
a cheerful room.

300
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:43,450
(mouse squeaking)

301
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:44,818
(screaming)

302
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,685
Ah, the doorbell.

303
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:47,353
That was
mrs. Charleston.

304
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:49,355
I thought
she was here.

305
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:52,024
I won't stay
in this filthy room.

306
00:21:52,026 --> 00:21:56,728
Very well, madam.
I'll attend to it
during dinner.

307
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,430
Thank you,
bensonsir.
Mum.

308
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:02,032
What?
Bensonmum.

309
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:03,633
Ma'am.

310
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:11,407
Baking flour.
What?

311
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:13,275
This dust
is baking flour.

312
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:16,077
These cobwebs are
candied sugar.

313
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,280
All placed here
just to frighten us.

314
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:23,484
And that mouse is
obviously a mechanical toy.

315
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:26,920
(chuckles)

316
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:29,355
Silly.
What?

317
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:30,789
I am.

318
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:32,290
It's real.

319
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:33,257
(screams)

320
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:35,592
(mouse squeaking)

321
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:39,929
Perrier: Stop.
We are here.

322
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:42,564
That's why
i stopped the car.
Open my door.

323
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,265
There is chocolate
all over your face.
What?

324
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,200
The candy bar.
It is all over your face.

325
00:22:46,202 --> 00:22:48,535
Fool. That's
my mustache.

326
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:50,803
Lick it and see.

327
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:56,909
Wipe it off.
My hands are sticky.

328
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:02,514
Hold still,
please.

329
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,682
Sloppy.

330
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,553
(woman screaming)

331
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,288
All in good time.

332
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,523
(knocking at door)

333
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:20,761
Yes.

334
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:23,596
Who's there?

335
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,333
Who's there,
i say?

336
00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:33,205
Filthy neighborhood.

337
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:34,539
Didn't l say "jump"?

338
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:38,409
<i>Un, deux, trois, jump.
Why don't you listen?</i>

339
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:40,377
Oh, leave me alone.

340
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:41,644
Sloppy.

341
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:44,013
(thunder rumbling)

342
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,194
Who are you?

343
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:08,702
Oh. You must be
the new kitchen maid.

344
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,071
I hope you can cook.

345
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:13,506
Hmm?
Answer me.

346
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,574
Speak up.

347
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:21,713
What's that?
I can't hear you.

348
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:24,582
A little shy,
are you?

349
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:26,350
Never mind.

350
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:29,820
There will be 10
for dinner.

351
00:24:31,924 --> 00:24:34,157
Here is the menu.

352
00:24:46,538 --> 00:24:48,337
Is that
understood?

353
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:50,238
Dinner will
be at 9:00.

354
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,905
When i want you,

355
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:54,408
That bell will ring
three times.

356
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,043
All right.
Get to work.

357
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:05,483
Hello?

358
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:07,751
Hello, hello?
Operator?

359
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:10,220
I am saying
hello, hello.

360
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:11,221
It's dead, sir.

361
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:14,490
What? Who is?
Who are you?

362
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:15,791
The butler, sir.

363
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:19,127
The butler, eh?
I thought as much.

364
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:23,498
That phone has not
worked for a week, sir.

365
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,199
Is that a fact?

366
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,934
And i say
that this wire

367
00:25:26,936 --> 00:25:29,503
Has been snipped,
not one hour ago.

368
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:31,505
As you can see.

369
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:33,572
What is your name?

370
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,473
Bensonmum.

371
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:38,942
Your little jest
escapes me.

372
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:41,110
<i>I am
monsieur milo perrier.</i>

373
00:25:41,112 --> 00:25:43,245
My chauffeur was injured
by a falling gargoyle

374
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:46,548
While standing outside
in chinese footprints.

375
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,816
We rang the bell,
a woman screamed,

376
00:25:48,818 --> 00:25:51,652
A mouse ran out
through the door.

377
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:53,520
As you can plainly see,

378
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:54,621
I miss nothing.

379
00:25:54,623 --> 00:25:56,322
Since we cannot
call for a doctor,

380
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:58,557
I need a cold compress
for my chauffeur

381
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,992
<i>And some hot chocolate
for me,  n'est-ce pas?</i>

382
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:04,795
We don't have nespa,
sir, just hershey's.

383
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,263
I'll call the maid.

384
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,034
(ringing)

385
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:15,470
(ringing continues)

386
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:22,976
I'll fetch it
for you myself, sir.

387
00:26:22,978 --> 00:26:24,043
In the meantime,

388
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:26,745
I'll show you
your room.

389
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,281
Get up.
Get up.

390
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:33,083
I do not trust
this butler.

391
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:36,786
Notice how his eyes
never look at you.

392
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:39,288
<i>He's blind,  monsieur.</i>

393
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,523
Nonsense.

394
00:26:46,962 --> 00:26:49,162
Sam:
There's the house now.

395
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:49,762
(groans)

396
00:26:49,764 --> 00:26:52,231
What's the matter?
My feet are
killing me.

397
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:57,202
Why didn't you
say we needed oil
before i got the gas?

398
00:26:57,204 --> 00:26:58,836
Because i gave you
a $50 bill

399
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:00,470
And the gas was
only five bucks.

400
00:27:00,472 --> 00:27:02,171
Maybe you'd come back,
maybe you wouldn't.

401
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:04,673
I couldn't take
that chance, angel.

402
00:27:04,675 --> 00:27:06,808
Don't you trust me, sam?

403
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,308
Trust you?

404
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,576
The last time
i trusted a dame

405
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:11,811
Was in paris in 1940.

406
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:14,213
She went out
to get some wine.

407
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:18,150
Two hours later,
the germans marched
into france.

408
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:19,684
I'm sorry, sam.

409
00:27:19,686 --> 00:27:23,054
Sorry, nothing.
Give me my change.

410
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:30,828
Dinner is
at 9:00, sir.

411
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,430
I'll have the maid
bring your chocolate.

412
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:35,932
One moment,
my good man.

413
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,333
Sir?

414
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:54,950
Thank you.
That will be all.

415
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:58,752
He's blind
all right.

416
00:27:58,754 --> 00:28:01,755
Those were
my funniest faces.

417
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:14,968
Not exactly
the copacabana.

418
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,036
I don't feel good
about this.

419
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,205
Maybe tonight's
the night
your luck ends.

420
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:21,072
Maybe so.

421
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,274
There's a number
on the wall for
all of us, angel.

422
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:27,678
If tonight's the night
they pick mine,
so be it.

423
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:30,913
After you,
sweetheart.

424
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:33,949
First kiss me,
sam.

425
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:35,383
I don't kiss.

426
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:36,417
Just this once,
sam.

427
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:40,387
I don't like kissing.
Now leave me alone.

428
00:28:45,994 --> 00:28:48,361
(woman screaming)

429
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:55,533
My god.
He's dead.

430
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:56,166
I beg your pardon.

431
00:28:56,168 --> 00:29:01,004
Sam diamond is
lying out there,
crushed to death.

432
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:04,540
I'm going to faint.
You catch me.

433
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:06,141
Madam.

434
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:08,009
Madam,
where are you?

435
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:10,578
All right.
Hold it right there.
Freeze, blinky.

436
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,114
Get your hands up.
Face the wall.

437
00:29:19,354 --> 00:29:21,687
Angel, you can
get up now.

438
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:24,156
Turn around,
jeeves.

439
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:30,328
Your concrete christmas
present arrived about
two seconds early,

440
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:30,961
No thanks to you.

441
00:29:30,963 --> 00:29:34,197
I apologize for
any unfortunate
mishap, sir.

442
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,932
May i put
my hands down?

443
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:38,334
Don't test your luck,
shakespeare.

444
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:41,303
I got your little
invitation to dinner.

445
00:29:41,305 --> 00:29:45,607
I didn't realize
i was the main course.

446
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:53,113
I had a kid brother
who got it the same way
two years ago.

447
00:29:53,248 --> 00:29:57,383
That boy would have
been 63 on tuesday.

448
00:29:57,451 --> 00:29:59,651
For two cents,
i'd take this...
Sam, no.

449
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:02,186
Get him away from me.

450
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:03,787
Get him away.

451
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:06,022
Get him away
before i stuff him

452
00:30:06,024 --> 00:30:07,323
Like those tiger trophies

453
00:30:07,325 --> 00:30:11,160
His limey pals hang up
on saloon walls.

454
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:12,761
Please.

455
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:17,398
He has a dreadful temper,
hasn't he?

456
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
(clock chiming)

457
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:34,715
9:00. Time
for dinner.

458
00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:38,185
Is everything
ready? Hmm?

459
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,086
(sniffing)

460
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,053
I don't
smell anything.

461
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:43,321
Very light on
the seasoning,
are you?

462
00:30:43,323 --> 00:30:47,625
Put the soup
in the tureen and
keep the squabs on low.

463
00:30:47,627 --> 00:30:50,127
I'll serve cocktails.

464
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:53,329
When you hear
the bell,

465
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:55,197
Bring out
the chilled asparagus

466
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:58,767
And turn up
the flame
on the squabs.

467
00:31:00,804 --> 00:31:03,037
Have you got that?

468
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,119
You didn't tell me
how l look, dickie.

469
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:22,956
No different than always,
absolutely ravishing.

470
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:25,325
Do you love
and adore me?

471
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:27,527
I love and adore you.

472
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:29,195
You still have
a great tush.

473
00:31:29,197 --> 00:31:31,864
Years of
horseback riding,
darling.

474
00:31:31,866 --> 00:31:33,932
Getting to
bottom of things?

475
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,101
Ah, wang.
Darling, you remember...
Of course.

476
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,402
Nice to see you,
ah wang.

477
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:40,737
Always a pleasure,
mrs. Charleston.

478
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:42,672
What a beautiful gown.

479
00:31:42,674 --> 00:31:44,173
Where did you get it?

480
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:46,775
This an old dress.

481
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:49,010
Had it for years.

482
00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:52,780
Please to meet
adopted son, willie.

483
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:54,148
Ah, east meets west

484
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,782
In a most
bizarre setting.

485
00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:57,049
Perrier.
Charleston.

486
00:31:57,051 --> 00:31:58,750
I didn't know
you were invited.

487
00:31:58,752 --> 00:31:59,917
You know wang.
Ah, yes.

488
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,055
I dined in shanghai long ago
with inspector wang.

489
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,890
(speaking fake chinese)

490
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,192
Oh, you remember.
Yes.

491
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,693
You had
hong ching chu,

492
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:14,929
And i had
cow dung wu fong.

493
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:17,698
My wife dora,
inspector perrier.

494
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,833
(speaking french)

495
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:20,933
(coughing)

496
00:32:20,935 --> 00:32:23,136
I'm sorry.
Our room is so dusty.

497
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:25,538
My fault.
I should have
blown first.

498
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,276
<i>May i present my
secretaire-chauffeur,
marcel cassette?</i>

499
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:33,279
Recovered from
your accident, marcel?

500
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:34,980
(responds in french)

501
00:32:34,982 --> 00:32:36,514
How did you know?

502
00:32:36,516 --> 00:32:37,848
From the way you bend.

503
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,516
Your right side
was smashed in

504
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:41,518
By a citroen,
i imagine.

505
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,686
I heard
a metallic sound,

506
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:46,488
So l think
you have an artificial hip.

507
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,223
Steel?
Aluminum.

508
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:50,758
You're still quick,
charleston.

509
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,460
And you,
mr. Charleston,
did not approve

510
00:32:53,462 --> 00:32:56,830
Of mrs. Charleston
dyeing hair blonde?

511
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,932
I beg your pardon?

512
00:32:58,934 --> 00:33:01,567
Mrs. Charleston
hair red.

513
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:05,003
You have blonde
hairs on shoulder.

514
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:09,374
That means she
has dyed red hair
to blonde

515
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,775
And back again
to red,

516
00:33:10,777 --> 00:33:13,744
Or else
you have been...

517
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:18,548
Ah, so sorry.
Wang is, ah,
wrong.

518
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:21,016
Shall we go
eat now?

519
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:28,756
Boy, pop.
You sure put your...

520
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:31,091
Shut japanese mouth.

521
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,827
Must be ghastly
to have a hip removed.

522
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:35,794
Does your hip hurt?

523
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:37,529
Only in damp weather.

524
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:38,663
(thunder rumbling)

525
00:33:38,665 --> 00:33:40,364
(screams in pain)

526
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:45,534
Are you all right?

527
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:49,337
Pay no attention.
You'll only
spoil him.

528
00:33:49,872 --> 00:33:52,038
Get up.
Get up.

529
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:54,473
(metallic clinking)

530
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:56,541
As i was saying...

531
00:33:56,543 --> 00:33:58,175
Hey, pop.

532
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:01,310
A treacherous road
like fresh mush...

533
00:34:01,312 --> 00:34:01,743
Hey, pop.

534
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:06,414
I know.
Dog stick tongue
out of picture.

535
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:10,050
Treacherous road
like fresh mushroom...

536
00:34:14,956 --> 00:34:15,955
He's a charming fellow.

537
00:34:15,957 --> 00:34:19,625
African death mask.
Died in some tribal ritual.

538
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:22,127
Wonder where others are.

539
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:23,928
Others?

540
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:25,763
What others?

541
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:28,298
Invitation to
dinner and murder

542
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,932
Finally clear to wang

543
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,934
<i>With appearance
of  monsieur perrier.</i>

544
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:36,538
Only the world's
greatest living detectives
were invited.

545
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,974
Five of us, darling.
Three already here.

546
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:41,608
Two have not
yet arrived.

547
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,577
Miss jessie marbles
of england, and mr...

548
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:47,646
Sam diamond
of san francisco.

549
00:34:47,748 --> 00:34:49,047
I know
who you all are.

550
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:53,084
This lady here
in the rented dress is
my secretary and mistress,

551
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:54,552
Miss tess skeffington.

552
00:34:54,554 --> 00:34:55,886
Oh, sam, don't...

553
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:57,120
Oh, i'm sorry,
sweetheart.

554
00:34:57,122 --> 00:35:01,190
Miss skeffington
thinks i'm too
brutally honest.

555
00:35:01,192 --> 00:35:03,425
But then,
we're in a brutal business.

556
00:35:03,427 --> 00:35:09,297
Never consider murder
to be business,
mr. Diamond.

557
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:11,132
Is that right?

558
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:12,199
Maybe not for you,
mr. Wang,

559
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:16,603
Because you put your
money into vegetables
in the late '30s.

560
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:21,741
You own 50%
of the bean sprouts
and bamboo shoots

561
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:24,543
Grown on
the chinese mainland.

562
00:35:24,545 --> 00:35:25,544
So you folks
can imagine

563
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:29,981
How much
chicken chow mein
mr. Wang has.

564
00:35:29,983 --> 00:35:32,717
Am i right,
angel?
Right.

565
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,352
That doesn't
seem important.

566
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:37,954
Or you,
mr. Perrier.

567
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:41,223
You work both sides
of the big drink.

568
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:44,459
You solve crimes
for barons and earls

569
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:48,062
And put your fancy fees
into swiss banks.

570
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,998
That buys a lot
of hot chocolate.

571
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,232
Now see here,
diamond.

572
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:55,034
No, you see,
mr. Charleston
of new york,

573
00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:58,170
Palm beach and
beverly hills.

574
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:00,539
Crime is
a hobby to you,

575
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:03,275
Just a game to pass
the time while waiting

576
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:05,210
For room service
in some fancy hotel.

577
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:09,948
Your wife's dough
buys you gin martinis
and $300 suits.

578
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:15,053
All you do is give your wife
a little grab now and then

579
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:17,789
And walk the dog.

580
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:18,756
Sorry if i'm
shocking you,

581
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:22,159
But i never went
to finishing school.

582
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:23,360
My school
is the streets,

583
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:26,963
And a pointed revolver
is my teacher.

584
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:31,200
I get $50 a day
and expenses.

585
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:34,436
I owe miss skeffington
three years' back pay.

586
00:36:34,438 --> 00:36:35,937
Isn't that right,
angel?

587
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:38,272
I don't care,
sam.

588
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:39,106
Neither do i.

589
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:42,476
Would someone give
my lady friend

590
00:36:42,478 --> 00:36:44,444
A glass of
cheap white wine?

591
00:36:44,446 --> 00:36:47,079
I'm going
to find the can.

592
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:51,049
I talk so much sometimes,
i forget to go.

593
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,819
Please excuse sam.

594
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:56,720
He was shot in the head
last week.

595
00:36:56,722 --> 00:36:59,155
He shouldn't be
out of the hospital.

596
00:36:59,157 --> 00:37:01,624
I think the fellow is
damned honest.

597
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:02,791
Dora:
Dickie, language.

598
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:07,028
Miss jessica marbles
and nurse.

599
00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:16,737
Ah, miss marbles.

600
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:18,605
So we
finally meet.

601
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:23,810
Have admire you
since i was tiny
little detective.

602
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:26,012
Thank you,
mr. Wang.

603
00:37:26,014 --> 00:37:28,247
I am jessica marbles.

604
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:31,750
This is
miss withers,
my nurse.

605
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:33,785
She's been
with me 52 years.

606
00:37:33,787 --> 00:37:36,921
I must take
care of her now.

607
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:39,623
Are you all right,
miss withers?

608
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,958
Do you want
your medicine?

609
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,259
No.

610
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,062
Ow!

611
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:51,933
She's off.

612
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:54,702
I could use
a stiff shot,
mr. Charleston.

613
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:58,706
I believe booze,
as you call it,
is your department.

614
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,340
My pleasure,
madam.

615
00:38:00,342 --> 00:38:03,042
Who's
the old geezer?

616
00:38:03,277 --> 00:38:04,643
Sam!

617
00:38:04,645 --> 00:38:06,344
Jessie, baby.

618
00:38:06,346 --> 00:38:08,546
Sam diamond!

619
00:38:08,548 --> 00:38:10,881
There's
a bullet hole
in your back.

620
00:38:10,883 --> 00:38:13,049
You should see
the other guy.

621
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:15,017
(man groaning)

622
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:16,518
Quiet, please.

623
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,454
Observe strange sound.

624
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:22,590
(groaning continues)

625
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,226
My god,
it's the face.

626
00:38:26,228 --> 00:38:28,361
It's coming
from the face.

627
00:38:28,363 --> 00:38:30,329
(groaning)

628
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:33,297
He's going through
his dying moments.

629
00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:34,331
What could
it mean?

630
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:38,168
Dinner, sir.
We have no gong.

631
00:38:46,344 --> 00:38:49,578
Ladies and gentlemen,
i propose a toast.

632
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:54,115
Our host,
mr. Lionel twain,
is a unique man.

633
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:58,853
Point one,
he has gathered the
world's greatest detectives

634
00:38:58,855 --> 00:39:02,356
To investigate a crime
that has not yet
been committed.

635
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:05,359
Point two,
he has set traps for us,

636
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:09,029
A bridge
that almost collapses,
falling statues.

637
00:39:09,031 --> 00:39:09,896
Does he mean
to kill us?

638
00:39:09,898 --> 00:39:12,965
Not yet.
He could've done
that at any time.

639
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,434
He's merely
whetting our appetites

640
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,035
For the rest of the game.

641
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:21,339
Point three,
why five detectives
instead of one?

642
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:24,375
Because he intends
to challenge us all,

643
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:28,345
A feat no criminal mind
has heretofore attempted.

644
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:31,781
Therefore, before this
hellish weekend begins,

645
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:34,083
I propose
that we toast

646
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:37,853
Either a most beguiling
and charming man,

647
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:41,957
Or an insidious,
fiendish madman.

648
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,592
Bottoms up.

649
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:46,527
One moment,
please.

650
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:49,796
Point four,
wine poisoned.

651
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:51,264
(all muttering)

652
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,766
An ancient,
tasteless, colorless

653
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,301
And odorless oriental herb

654
00:39:56,303 --> 00:39:58,169
That kills instantly.

655
00:39:58,171 --> 00:40:00,237
Observe, please.

656
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:05,041
(all gasping)

657
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:10,546
Great scott.
Mr. Wang, you've
saved our lives.

658
00:40:10,548 --> 00:40:13,682
Not quite,
mrs. Charleston.

659
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,816
Bon appetit.

660
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:18,185
(all screaming)

661
00:40:18,754 --> 00:40:22,255
<i>Only  monsieur wang
could detect
the poison,</i>

662
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:23,956
So only
he was tested.

663
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,992
Point five,
mr. Twain is both

664
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:29,995
Beguiling and fiendish.

665
00:40:30,897 --> 00:40:32,596
(groans)

666
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:33,329
Oh!

667
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,297
Oh, get a doctor,
quick.

668
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,865
No,
it's all right.

669
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,666
My wine is
not poisoned.

670
00:40:38,668 --> 00:40:41,468
It was just
a bad year.

671
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:43,035
Good work, mr. Wang.

672
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:44,569
We must all
be on our guard

673
00:40:44,571 --> 00:40:47,272
Through every course
of the meal.

674
00:40:47,274 --> 00:40:50,642
You're all
forgetting one thing.

675
00:40:50,644 --> 00:40:53,111
This makes the butler
suspicious.

676
00:40:53,113 --> 00:40:54,979
He poured the wine.

677
00:40:54,981 --> 00:40:56,380
Except he is blind.

678
00:40:56,382 --> 00:40:59,616
How would he know
which one to serve
the poisoned glass to?

679
00:40:59,618 --> 00:41:00,950
That's very simple.

680
00:41:00,952 --> 00:41:04,987
Blind people have
a very keen sense
of smell.

681
00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:06,922
Since we're
anglo-saxon

682
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:09,090
And mr. Wang's son
is japanese,

683
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,192
It wouldn't be hard
to sniff out the chinaman.

684
00:41:11,194 --> 00:41:14,261
Charleston: See here.
That's a tacky thing
to say.

685
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,230
It's a tacky world,
mr. Charleston.

686
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:18,497
Isn't that right,
angel?

687
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:19,531
That's right, sam.

688
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:23,067
Quiet, please.
Butler approaches.

689
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:24,334
I apologize
for the delay.

690
00:41:24,336 --> 00:41:28,738
I'm having
communication problems
with the cook.

691
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,538
Who poured the wine?

692
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:35,610
Mr. Twain, sir.
He left it in
the refrigerator.

693
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:37,345
I was told
to give mr. Wang

694
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:40,014
The glass with
the sticky stem.

695
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:41,281
And you didn't
ask why?

696
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:44,317
I was lucky to find
the refrigerator, sir.

697
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,452
I will serve
the soup now.

698
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:48,854
Perrier:
By all means.

699
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:53,491
(inaudible)

700
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:57,227
(inaudible)

701
00:41:58,997 --> 00:42:01,330
Yes,
i'm starving.

702
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:19,414
One moment.
Where is the soup?

703
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:20,415
In your dish, sir.

704
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:24,419
There is nothing
in my dish
but my dish.

705
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:26,254
I don't understand,
sir.

706
00:42:26,256 --> 00:42:30,191
Take the spoon.
Taste it yourself.

707
00:42:38,768 --> 00:42:40,934
I see what
you mean, sir.

708
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:42,068
If you'll
excuse me,

709
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,071
I need to talk
with the cook.

710
00:42:47,141 --> 00:42:48,840
Murder by starvation.

711
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:51,342
Maybe that's his game.

712
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:52,943
What do you think, sam?

713
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:58,248
Ask the moose.
He's been
watching us.

714
00:42:59,384 --> 00:43:01,917
(all murmuring)

715
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:03,151
Ten people for dinner,

716
00:43:03,153 --> 00:43:06,120
And i'm serving
hot nothing.

717
00:43:06,122 --> 00:43:09,256
You can't get
good help today.

718
00:43:14,496 --> 00:43:18,264
You're fired.
Do you understand?
Fired.

719
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:21,800
I want you out.
Do you hear?

720
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,306
And stay out.

721
00:43:31,243 --> 00:43:33,009
Something just
occurred to me.

722
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:34,176
The seating's all wrong.

723
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,677
How so,
mr. Charleston?

724
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,612
I'm sitting
next to dora.

725
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:38,279
What's wrong with that?

726
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:39,513
She's your wife,
isn't she?

727
00:43:39,515 --> 00:43:43,583
At a dinner party,
a husband and wife
shouldn't sit together.

728
00:43:43,585 --> 00:43:45,751
I should be
on the opposite side
of the table.

729
00:43:45,753 --> 00:43:48,286
Mr. Wang,
please change places
with me.

730
00:43:48,288 --> 00:43:49,520
Now?

731
00:43:49,522 --> 00:43:50,988
Now.

732
00:43:51,957 --> 00:43:52,889
(all screaming)

733
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:56,392
Just as i thought.
Another test that
almost killed us.

734
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:59,795
Saved only because
i am enormously well-bred.

735
00:43:59,797 --> 00:44:03,765
Lucky it wasn't me.
I'd be chopped
liver now.

736
00:44:06,002 --> 00:44:07,334
(all clamoring)

737
00:44:07,336 --> 00:44:10,670
Wang:
Silence, please.
Do not panic.

738
00:44:10,672 --> 00:44:12,071
No person move
from place.

739
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:15,741
Charleston:
Someone just
came in.

740
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,177
Quiet, everyone.
I smell something.

741
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:20,745
Miss marbles:
What is it?

742
00:44:20,747 --> 00:44:23,681
Good god.
Franks and beans.

743
00:44:23,683 --> 00:44:26,283
I'm afraid that's
all we have, sir.

744
00:44:26,285 --> 00:44:28,785
Dora:
Dickie, don't
touch me there.

745
00:44:28,787 --> 00:44:31,821
Charleston:
My hands are
in my pockets.

746
00:44:31,823 --> 00:44:33,422
Sam:
They're my pockets.

747
00:44:33,424 --> 00:44:34,356
Charleston:
Sorry about that.

748
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:37,158
Dora:
Dickie, behave yourself.

749
00:44:38,828 --> 00:44:41,662
Twain:
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

750
00:44:41,664 --> 00:44:44,631
I'm your host,
lionel twain.

751
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,613
Good god.
What an entrance.

752
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,616
A bit theatrical,
miss marbles,

753
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,551
But i do
love illusion.

754
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:09,554
Please forgive my hat.
I'm losing my hair.

755
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:13,057
I thought
twain was older.
72, 73.

756
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:17,361
Seventy-six to be exact,
mr. Diamond.

757
00:45:17,363 --> 00:45:18,995
How do i
look so young?

758
00:45:18,997 --> 00:45:22,565
Quite simple.
A complete vegetable diet,

759
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:24,667
Twelve hours sleep
a night

760
00:45:24,669 --> 00:45:27,169
And lots and lots of make-up.

761
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:30,505
I trust you've all been
made comfortable.

762
00:45:30,507 --> 00:45:31,672
Comfortable,
mr. Twain?

763
00:45:31,674 --> 00:45:36,109
Do you call poison,
a near decapitation,
comfortable?

764
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:39,512
No, i call it
inspiration.

765
00:45:39,514 --> 00:45:40,479
You still
must explain

766
00:45:40,481 --> 00:45:44,316
<i>The attempts
on our lives,
monsieur twain.</i>

767
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:47,152
<i>Merely games,
monsieur perrier.</i>

768
00:45:47,154 --> 00:45:50,088
Pitting wits with you,
so to speak.

769
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:54,926
Pit your wits with me
and you won't have wits
to pit with.

770
00:45:54,928 --> 00:45:57,662
You're spitting
on the nurse.

771
00:45:57,664 --> 00:45:59,163
Sorry, old lady.

772
00:45:59,165 --> 00:46:00,664
Crazy broad
should be in bed.

773
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:04,334
<i>Monsieur twain,
after four hours,
we haven't seen</i>

774
00:46:04,336 --> 00:46:07,070
A hot dinner
or a cold corpse.

775
00:46:07,072 --> 00:46:09,539
I therefore
bid you adieu.

776
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:11,140
I bid one adieu,
also.

777
00:46:11,142 --> 00:46:14,176
No one is
leaving this house.

778
00:46:25,322 --> 00:46:27,989
What meaning of this,
mr. Twain?

779
00:46:27,991 --> 00:46:31,125
I will tell you, mr. Wang,
if you can tell me

780
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:34,428
Why a man with
such a brilliant mind

781
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,997
Can't say his
prepositions or articles.

782
00:46:36,999 --> 00:46:41,134
"the," mr. Wang.
What is "the" meaning of this?

783
00:46:41,136 --> 00:46:42,401
That what i said.

784
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:44,569
What meaning of this?

785
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:46,103
The meaning of this is

786
00:46:46,105 --> 00:46:49,673
I have decided to
prove beyond a doubt

787
00:46:49,675 --> 00:46:53,376
That the greatest
living criminologist
in the world

788
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:55,277
Is sitting
at this table,

789
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,313
And you are all
looking at him.

790
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,581
No, don't look
at each other.

791
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:03,116
Look at me!
I'm the greatest.

792
00:47:03,118 --> 00:47:04,350
I'm number one.

793
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:06,719
You look like
number two.

794
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:08,554
Know what i mean?

795
00:47:08,556 --> 00:47:10,289
What does he mean?

796
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,291
Tell you later.
It's disgusting.

797
00:47:12,293 --> 00:47:16,161
In all your
various adventures,

798
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:19,430
Not one of you has ever
had an unsolved murder.

799
00:47:19,432 --> 00:47:23,934
Your reputations exist
on this single fact.

800
00:47:23,936 --> 00:47:26,937
But what would
the world say

801
00:47:26,939 --> 00:47:29,839
If the five greatest
living detectives

802
00:47:29,841 --> 00:47:33,776
Found themselves trapped
in a country house,

803
00:47:33,778 --> 00:47:35,477
Shut off from the world,

804
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,979
Only to discover
a body on the floor,

805
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:41,816
Stabbed 12 times
in the back with
a butcher's knife,

806
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:48,355
And not one able
to solve the crime?

807
00:47:48,357 --> 00:47:49,289
You mean murder?

808
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,590
Dora, please.
We're talking shop.

809
00:47:50,592 --> 00:47:53,392
Yes! Murder,
mrs. Charleston.

810
00:47:53,394 --> 00:47:54,993
Exactly at midnight,

811
00:47:54,995 --> 00:47:58,629
Someone in this
house will be
viciously murdered.

812
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:03,200
Left out one small
detail, mr. Twain.

813
00:48:03,869 --> 00:48:05,768
Who victim?

814
00:48:05,903 --> 00:48:08,803
"is the!" "is the!"

815
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:10,604
Who "is the" victim?

816
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:12,272
That drives me crazy!

817
00:48:12,274 --> 00:48:15,341
Sounds like
a short ride to me.

818
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:18,242
Well, we shall see
who is sane

819
00:48:18,244 --> 00:48:21,511
And who is crazy
around here.

820
00:48:22,013 --> 00:48:27,816
Mr. Wang, the victim
is at this very table
at this very moment,

821
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:31,186
And so, too,
ladies and gentlemen,

822
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:33,521
Is the murderer.

823
00:48:33,523 --> 00:48:34,588
Murder-poo?

824
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:39,225
Yes, dear.
We're going to have
a lovely murder-poo.

825
00:48:39,227 --> 00:48:39,858
(giggles)

826
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,028
Why don't you
push her wheelchair
down the driveway?

827
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,463
You know who's
gonna get it?

828
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:46,996
Intimately.

829
00:48:46,998 --> 00:48:49,498
And you know
the method?
Definitely.

830
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,968
And exactly what time
murder to take place?

831
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:54,302
"the" murder.

832
00:48:54,304 --> 00:48:55,036
Precisely.

833
00:48:55,038 --> 00:48:56,270
Well, i know
it's none of my business,

834
00:48:56,272 --> 00:49:00,207
But doesn't that mean
that you're the murderer,
mr. Twain?

835
00:49:00,209 --> 00:49:00,840
No wives.

836
00:49:00,842 --> 00:49:02,708
I refuse to discuss
this with wives.

837
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,610
Dora is quite right.
All fingers do seem
to point to you.

838
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:07,211
It's not much
of a challenge.

839
00:49:07,213 --> 00:49:10,113
Shall i make it
more interesting,
mr. Charleston?

840
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:13,783
$1 million to the one
who solves the crime.

841
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:16,819
Wagered against
your reputations.

842
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:18,854
$1 million in
tax-free cash.

843
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:23,225
Also, the paperback rights
and the film sale.

844
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:24,593
<i>It's 11:00,  amigos.</i>

845
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:29,264
One hour
before death strikes
someone in this room.

846
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,999
See you at midnight.

847
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:32,900
Toodle-oo!

848
00:49:35,004 --> 00:49:37,938
<i>See here,
monsieur twain!</i>

849
00:49:38,707 --> 00:49:39,305
He's gone!

850
00:49:39,307 --> 00:49:41,874
No, he's not.
He's down there.

851
00:49:41,876 --> 00:49:42,507
(all gasp)

852
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:45,009
Fast little
bunny rabbit,
ain't you?

853
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:47,545
I've never moved,
mr. Diamond.

854
00:49:47,547 --> 00:49:48,846
I'm still down there.

855
00:49:48,848 --> 00:49:51,114
A stunt done
with mirrors.

856
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:52,448
Is that so?

857
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,184
Willing to risk
seven years bad luck?

858
00:49:55,186 --> 00:49:56,652
Try it, mr. Diamond.

859
00:49:56,654 --> 00:49:59,554
It's your funeral,
butterball.

860
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:01,789
(all gasp)
wait!

861
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:04,758
Sometimes it
doesn't work.

862
00:50:05,527 --> 00:50:08,895
You've won this round,
mr. Diamond.

863
00:50:08,897 --> 00:50:11,731
My turn comes
at midnight.

864
00:50:20,174 --> 00:50:23,275
I hope he can
stop that thing.

865
00:50:23,377 --> 00:50:26,044
If you ask me,
anybody offering
a million bucks

866
00:50:26,046 --> 00:50:28,880
For a crime
that's not committed,

867
00:50:28,882 --> 00:50:30,915
That's nuts.

868
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:34,218
Should we wait
until someone's
butchered?

869
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,719
What's happened
to the butler?

870
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:40,123
Why hasn't he returned
with our dinner?

871
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:41,657
Go look for him.

872
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:44,126
No one leave.

873
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:44,960
Why not, pop?

874
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:47,862
Twain say victim
at this table.

875
00:50:47,864 --> 00:50:49,196
If we stay together,

876
00:50:49,198 --> 00:50:52,132
Crime cannot be committed
without witnesses.

877
00:50:52,134 --> 00:50:54,167
You're one smart
chinaman, mr. Wang.

878
00:50:54,169 --> 00:50:59,906
Joining hands
will make the
chain stronger.

879
00:50:59,908 --> 00:51:02,174
Join hands, please.

880
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,477
(ticking)

881
00:51:13,753 --> 00:51:15,586
Stop that.

882
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:20,556
Stop it, i said.

883
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:22,024
What is it,
diamond?

884
00:51:22,026 --> 00:51:25,093
She's giving
my palm the finger,
the dirty broad.

885
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:27,528
Naughty, naughty,
miss withers.

886
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,263
(giggling)

887
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,399
(inaudible)

888
00:51:33,401 --> 00:51:36,201
Good god! Look!

889
00:51:36,203 --> 00:51:38,036
(inaudible)

890
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:41,872
Tess: What is she doing?

891
00:51:41,874 --> 00:51:44,140
Screaming.
What is it?

892
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:44,740
What's happened?

893
00:51:44,742 --> 00:51:47,309
Something wrong
in kitchen.
With our dinner!

894
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:48,376
No, no.
Patience, patience.

895
00:51:48,378 --> 00:51:51,645
Is someone in there?
Is someone in the
kitchen with dinner?

896
00:51:51,647 --> 00:51:54,347
Cook cannot
speak or hear.

897
00:51:56,184 --> 00:51:58,250
"i think
butler is dead.

898
00:51:58,252 --> 00:52:02,754
"my name is yetta.
I don't work thursdays."

899
00:52:02,756 --> 00:52:04,255
Ask if she sleeps in.

900
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:05,556
We must
investigate this.

901
00:52:05,558 --> 00:52:07,157
Someone has to go.
Not alone.

902
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:09,559
Mr. Charleston,
mr. Diamond stay.

903
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:11,827
<i>Miss marbles,
monsieur perrier</i>

904
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,930
And wang will
investigate.

905
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,400
Oh, that's right.

906
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,902
Let it all out.

907
00:52:24,006 --> 00:52:25,805
(inaudible)

908
00:52:27,074 --> 00:52:28,606
Careful, wang!

909
00:52:28,608 --> 00:52:30,374
Fingerprints.

910
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:32,576
Where?
Yours.

911
00:52:32,578 --> 00:52:35,712
Here, take
my handkerchief.

912
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:51,060
Is he...
Looks...

913
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:53,028
Seems like...

914
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,196
(both gasp)
don't touch him!

915
00:52:55,198 --> 00:52:56,530
Fingerprints.

916
00:52:56,532 --> 00:52:58,298
Quite so.

917
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,432
Pencil.

918
00:52:59,434 --> 00:53:01,167
Pencil.

919
00:53:14,782 --> 00:53:16,948
Wang: No pulse,

920
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,683
No heartbeat.

921
00:53:19,685 --> 00:53:25,055
If condition
does not change,
this man is dead.

922
00:53:25,057 --> 00:53:26,689
No signs of foul play.

923
00:53:26,691 --> 00:53:30,092
Hold on!
What's this?

924
00:53:31,495 --> 00:53:34,896
What do you
make of this, perrier?

925
00:53:35,098 --> 00:53:37,031
<i>Poison,
n'est-ce pas?</i>

926
00:53:37,033 --> 00:53:39,266
Not nespa, cocoa.

927
00:53:39,868 --> 00:53:42,568
At last,
we have our murder.

928
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,335
Not quite.

929
00:53:43,337 --> 00:53:46,604
Twain say murder victim
sitting at our table.

930
00:53:46,606 --> 00:53:48,439
Butler not at our table.

931
00:53:48,441 --> 00:53:50,407
Butler only killed
to divert us

932
00:53:50,409 --> 00:53:53,610
From real murder
still to come.

933
00:53:53,612 --> 00:53:54,811
(both gasp)

934
00:53:54,813 --> 00:53:56,179
(screams)
look!

935
00:53:56,181 --> 00:53:58,047
A knife is missing!

936
00:53:58,049 --> 00:54:00,182
The butcher's knife,
i'll wager.

937
00:54:00,184 --> 00:54:01,550
The others
are in danger.

938
00:54:01,552 --> 00:54:04,319
What is exact time,
please?

939
00:54:05,021 --> 00:54:07,888
11:31 and 56 seconds.

940
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,156
57, 58...

941
00:54:10,158 --> 00:54:11,924
Tell me
when to stop.

942
00:54:11,926 --> 00:54:12,691
59, 60.

943
00:54:12,693 --> 00:54:15,560
Twenty-eight minutes
to main murder.

944
00:54:15,562 --> 00:54:16,861
Back to dining room.

945
00:54:16,863 --> 00:54:19,864
Must be together
at midnight.

946
00:54:21,334 --> 00:54:23,167
One moment!

947
00:54:25,404 --> 00:54:27,103
(gasps)

948
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,839
Wang: Handkerchief.

949
00:54:40,985 --> 00:54:42,250
What is it?

950
00:54:42,252 --> 00:54:43,150
A bill.

951
00:54:43,152 --> 00:54:44,918
Everything's rented
for tonight.

952
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,588
The butler, cook,
food and chairs.

953
00:54:48,756 --> 00:54:50,088
You mean...

954
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:54,425
This entire murder
has been catered.

955
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,063
It's twain's doing.
He's crazy.

956
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:01,431
Ah, yes, but no fool.

957
00:55:01,433 --> 00:55:03,900
I hope we're in time.

958
00:55:03,902 --> 00:55:04,634
Door locked.

959
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:07,670
Sam diamond
probably locked it.

960
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:10,439
Good thinking
on diamond head.

961
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:12,274
Diamond,
it's perrier.

962
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:14,843
It's all right.
Open up.

963
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:17,912
Diamond, charleston.
Are you in there?

964
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:22,449
Get key from pocket
of dead butler.

965
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:27,887
Don't say "dead."
i have to reach
into his pocket.

966
00:55:32,126 --> 00:55:33,925
(exclaims)

967
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,066
<i>Holy  merde!</i>

968
00:55:49,174 --> 00:55:50,173
Miss skeffington!

969
00:55:50,175 --> 00:55:53,476
Miss marbles:
Miss skeffington!
Miss withers!

970
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:53,943
He is gone.

971
00:55:53,945 --> 00:55:57,012
Who's gone?
The butler.
His body is missing.

972
00:55:57,014 --> 00:55:57,979
Here's the key.

973
00:55:57,981 --> 00:55:59,513
Where you find key?

974
00:55:59,515 --> 00:56:01,147
In his pocket.
What pocket?

975
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,248
The butler's pocket.

976
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,383
Butler gone,
but pocket there?

977
00:56:04,385 --> 00:56:04,916
Exactly.

978
00:56:04,918 --> 00:56:07,551
Somebody stole his body,
but left his clothes.

979
00:56:07,553 --> 00:56:09,152
Quickly!
Open the door.

980
00:56:09,154 --> 00:56:12,121
Something is
wrong here.

981
00:56:16,527 --> 00:56:19,694
Hello!
Where is everyone?

982
00:56:19,696 --> 00:56:23,030
Room filled
with empty people.

983
00:56:23,032 --> 00:56:25,599
I'll try
the other door.

984
00:56:27,069 --> 00:56:29,135
It's locked
from the inside.

985
00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:29,602
Strange.

986
00:56:29,604 --> 00:56:31,904
Both doors locked
from inside,
yet no way out.

987
00:56:31,906 --> 00:56:34,172
I don't like it.
I don't like it one bit!

988
00:56:34,174 --> 00:56:37,575
I like, but
don't understand.

989
00:56:37,743 --> 00:56:38,942
Maybe other way
out of room.

990
00:56:38,944 --> 00:56:42,312
Secret passageway,
perhaps.

991
00:56:43,048 --> 00:56:47,016
Twain: There are no secret
passageways, mr. Wang.

992
00:56:47,018 --> 00:56:48,851
You spoke?
No.

993
00:56:48,853 --> 00:56:50,118
Not me.

994
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,686
I spoke.

995
00:56:52,922 --> 00:56:54,021
Ah! There!

996
00:56:54,023 --> 00:56:56,123
Voice come from cow
on wall.

997
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:59,459
Moose! Moose,
you imbecile!

998
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:00,059
Where are they?

999
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:02,828
What have you done
with the others,
you short madman?

1000
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,996
Ah-ha! Stumped already!

1001
00:57:04,998 --> 00:57:07,898
<i>Need some clues,
monsieur perrier?</i>

1002
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,065
Clues!
I need no clues.

1003
00:57:09,067 --> 00:57:11,967
I find my own clues,
you demented lollipop!

1004
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:13,601
Calm yourself.
Man who argue
with cow on wall

1005
00:57:13,603 --> 00:57:16,437
Is like train
without wheels.
Get nowhere.

1006
00:57:16,439 --> 00:57:18,539
Okay, quiet.
I'm sick of your
fortune cookies.

1007
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:21,141
Man who sick of
fortune cookies...

1008
00:57:21,143 --> 00:57:23,910
I'm sick of
fortune cookies...

1009
00:57:23,912 --> 00:57:25,077
(shushing)

1010
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:26,311
Cow talk again.

1011
00:57:26,313 --> 00:57:29,013
Need a hint,
miss marbles?

1012
00:57:29,015 --> 00:57:31,181
You mistake
what you assume.

1013
00:57:31,183 --> 00:57:33,850
They never left
the dining room.

1014
00:57:33,852 --> 00:57:36,252
Count the numbers
1 to 10,

1015
00:57:36,254 --> 00:57:38,587
Turn the knob
and try again.

1016
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:39,754
(laughing)

1017
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:41,655
What the devil
does that mean?

1018
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:43,423
"they never left
the dining room."

1019
00:57:43,425 --> 00:57:44,157
Certainly they did.

1020
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:45,958
Do not mistake
what you assume,
miss marbles.

1021
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,960
Quick, back
out in hall.
Why?

1022
00:57:47,962 --> 00:57:50,662
We assume
others not here.

1023
00:57:50,664 --> 00:57:53,164
Cow say they in room.

1024
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:55,733
Let's look once more.

1025
00:57:57,504 --> 00:58:01,072
<i>Please close door,
monsieur perrier.</i>

1026
00:58:02,008 --> 00:58:03,707
I cannot see
what possible...

1027
00:58:03,709 --> 00:58:07,410
Quiet.
7, 8, 9, 10.

1028
00:58:07,412 --> 00:58:11,347
Miss marbles,
open door, please.

1029
00:58:17,288 --> 00:58:20,355
Where were you, wang?
We was worried.

1030
00:58:20,357 --> 00:58:21,522
Where were you?

1031
00:58:21,524 --> 00:58:24,358
We were here.
You said don't leave.

1032
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,860
You haven't
left this room?

1033
00:58:26,862 --> 00:58:28,494
All: No.

1034
00:58:28,496 --> 00:58:30,395
Answer simple,

1035
00:58:30,397 --> 00:58:33,064
But question hard.

1036
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:33,931
Where's the butler?

1037
00:58:33,933 --> 00:58:36,833
Butler completely
murdered.

1038
00:58:36,835 --> 00:58:37,500
Poisoned.

1039
00:58:37,502 --> 00:58:39,768
A butcher knife
is missing.

1040
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:43,071
We came to tell you,
but the doors were locked.

1041
00:58:43,073 --> 00:58:45,873
I wanted
the butler's key,

1042
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,774
But his body
was missing.

1043
00:58:47,776 --> 00:58:49,175
He had been
stripped naked.

1044
00:58:49,177 --> 00:58:51,343
His clothes
were left.

1045
00:58:51,345 --> 00:58:52,010
I don't understand.

1046
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:55,613
Why would anyone steal
a dead, naked body?

1047
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,816
Well, dear,
there are people...

1048
00:59:00,419 --> 00:59:02,018
That's tacky.

1049
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,519
That's really tacky.

1050
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:07,656
Then we returned here,
opened the door,

1051
00:59:07,658 --> 00:59:09,124
But the room was empty.

1052
00:59:09,126 --> 00:59:10,925
You were all gone.

1053
00:59:10,927 --> 00:59:11,926
(chuckles)

1054
00:59:11,928 --> 00:59:14,495
The moose head told us
not to assume

1055
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:16,630
That you'd left
the dining room.

1056
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:21,334
So we counted to 10
and tried it again.

1057
00:59:21,336 --> 00:59:24,170
And here you were.

1058
00:59:24,172 --> 00:59:27,373
I'm not one to
use hyperbole,

1059
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,874
But i'll tell you this,

1060
00:59:28,876 --> 00:59:30,075
For the first time
in my life,

1061
00:59:30,077 --> 00:59:33,378
I had the ca-ca
scared out of me.

1062
00:59:34,114 --> 00:59:37,882
I like her.
I really like her.

1063
00:59:38,184 --> 00:59:38,815
(gunshots)

1064
00:59:38,817 --> 00:59:40,750
<i>Gunshots,  monsieur.
Gunshots, pop.</i>

1065
00:59:40,752 --> 00:59:43,152
Gunshots, sam.
Gunshots, dickie.

1066
00:59:43,154 --> 00:59:44,620
Shoes!

1067
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,222
This time,
charleston
and i will go.

1068
00:59:47,224 --> 00:59:49,190
Everybody else
stay here.

1069
00:59:49,192 --> 00:59:51,759
Let's go,
charleston.

1070
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:59,132
What do you make
of all this, wang?

1071
01:00:01,936 --> 01:00:03,001
Is confusing.

1072
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:08,840
"it!" "it" is confusing.
Say your pronouns!

1073
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,541
(scoffs)

1074
01:00:14,947 --> 01:00:16,880
Open the door.

1075
01:00:17,282 --> 01:00:19,715
Good god!
What is it?

1076
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:21,416
He's back.

1077
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:26,353
And au naturel.

1078
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:27,654
I don't get it.

1079
01:00:27,656 --> 01:00:31,224
First they steal
the body and leave
the clothes.

1080
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:36,395
Who would steal
the clothes and bring
the body back?

1081
01:00:36,397 --> 01:00:38,930
Possibly some
deranged dry cleaner.

1082
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:40,598
What about the gunshots?

1083
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,067
Why shoot someone
who'd been poisoned?

1084
01:00:43,069 --> 01:00:46,236
True. We heard gunshots,
but i don't see
any bullet holes.

1085
01:00:46,238 --> 01:00:49,239
Not in his head, his neck,
his back or his chest.

1086
01:00:49,241 --> 01:00:51,174
Look all over him.

1087
01:00:51,176 --> 01:00:52,675
All over his body?

1088
01:00:52,677 --> 01:00:54,510
Somebody has to do it.

1089
01:00:54,512 --> 01:00:56,812
I'll stand guard.
You look.

1090
01:00:56,814 --> 01:00:58,480
All right.
We'll take turns.

1091
01:00:58,482 --> 01:01:00,915
Search the first
naked body.

1092
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:04,385
I'll search the
second one we find.

1093
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:05,586
(thunder rumbling)

1094
01:01:05,588 --> 01:01:09,022
Hurry up.
We only got eight minutes.

1095
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:14,960
(groans)

1096
01:01:16,463 --> 01:01:17,728
You see anything?

1097
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:20,430
I don't see
a bullet hole.

1098
01:01:20,432 --> 01:01:23,032
Hold it,
i see something.

1099
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:24,066
What is it?

1100
01:01:24,068 --> 01:01:26,401
Forget it. My mistake.
Not a bullet hole.

1101
01:01:26,403 --> 01:01:29,837
Then what about
the shots?

1102
01:01:30,139 --> 01:01:31,471
Divide and conquer.

1103
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:33,039
What?
Another diversion.

1104
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:34,840
He gives us
meaningless clues

1105
01:01:34,842 --> 01:01:39,444
And dangles red herrings
before our eyes

1106
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,112
As precious seconds
tick away.

1107
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,614
Another murder
is still to come.

1108
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:47,851
You're not
my type of cop,
but you smell good.

1109
01:01:47,853 --> 01:01:51,354
If you're not a pansy,
what are you?

1110
01:01:51,656 --> 01:01:52,955
Classy, i suppose.

1111
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:54,823
Dames love
guys like you.

1112
01:01:54,825 --> 01:01:55,890
I don't see
what possibly...

1113
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:58,959
You ever make it
with a waitress?
What?

1114
01:01:58,961 --> 01:01:59,759
A waitress.

1115
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:01,694
A big fat waitress.

1116
01:02:01,696 --> 01:02:03,328
I don't know
about society dames,

1117
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:08,399
But you ain't had it
until you've made it
with a fat waitress.

1118
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:12,102
If you're interested,
give me a call.

1119
01:02:17,709 --> 01:02:19,308
Bizarre little twit.

1120
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:21,977
I'm not sure about him.

1121
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:30,117
What are you doing?

1122
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:32,686
My hands
need washing.
Good.

1123
01:02:32,688 --> 01:02:33,953
I'll be right out.

1124
01:02:33,955 --> 01:02:36,021
I'll tell them.

1125
01:02:37,357 --> 01:02:40,891
You're never going
to believe this.

1126
01:02:40,993 --> 01:02:43,326
All right,
where are you?

1127
01:02:43,328 --> 01:02:45,761
What the hell
is going on?

1128
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:49,965
Charleston, wash up later.
We've got problems.

1129
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:57,538
Locked from the inside.

1130
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:02,175
That can only
mean one thing,

1131
01:03:02,477 --> 01:03:05,044
And i don't know
what it is.

1132
01:03:05,046 --> 01:03:07,012
Charleston!

1133
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:13,317
You'll never believe...

1134
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:15,352
(growling)

1135
01:03:22,994 --> 01:03:25,227
I'll be right out!

1136
01:03:32,402 --> 01:03:35,936
I don't remember
closing that door.

1137
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:43,944
What happened?

1138
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,913
What were
the gunshots?

1139
01:03:50,884 --> 01:03:52,850
Did anybody leave?

1140
01:03:52,852 --> 01:03:55,085
It happened
to you, too?

1141
01:03:55,087 --> 01:03:57,387
Where's my dickie?

1142
01:03:57,555 --> 01:03:58,687
Sorry.
Where's my husband?

1143
01:03:58,689 --> 01:04:03,124
Two minutes to midnight,
if anyone's interested.

1144
01:04:03,126 --> 01:04:04,692
It ain't possible.

1145
01:04:04,694 --> 01:04:06,860
Eight people
in a dining room

1146
01:04:06,862 --> 01:04:09,195
Can't suddenly
disappear.

1147
01:04:09,197 --> 01:04:10,763
Unless...

1148
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:11,330
What?

1149
01:04:11,332 --> 01:04:12,864
Unless it
never happened.

1150
01:04:12,866 --> 01:04:14,699
I see your point,
diamond.

1151
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:18,469
When is a full
dining room not full?

1152
01:04:18,471 --> 01:04:20,838
When there's
two dining rooms.

1153
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,005
Exactly!

1154
01:04:22,007 --> 01:04:23,139
Two dining rooms?

1155
01:04:23,141 --> 01:04:25,307
Two dining rooms,
two of everything.

1156
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:26,708
Twain electronic genius.

1157
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:31,579
He has devised a way
to move this room
quickly and silently,

1158
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:32,613
In the flash of an eye,

1159
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:36,183
To be replaced by
an identical room.

1160
01:04:36,185 --> 01:04:37,050
I knew it!

1161
01:04:37,052 --> 01:04:39,052
Please.
I shall demonstrate.

1162
01:04:39,054 --> 01:04:44,991
I'll walk out the door,
return, and you will
all be gone.

1163
01:04:44,993 --> 01:04:46,392
Observe.

1164
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,032
I've figured it out.

1165
01:04:54,034 --> 01:04:56,000
There are two
of everything.

1166
01:04:56,002 --> 01:04:58,435
Oh, dickie,
that's old news.

1167
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:00,837
Everybody take
your seats.

1168
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:02,672
I'm scared, sam.
Hold me.

1169
01:05:02,674 --> 01:05:05,174
Hold yourself.
I'm busy.

1170
01:05:05,176 --> 01:05:06,475
Sit in your same seat.

1171
01:05:06,477 --> 01:05:10,912
<i>40 seconds!
I'm worried about
monsieur perrier.</i>

1172
01:05:10,914 --> 01:05:12,346
I'll look for him.

1173
01:05:12,348 --> 01:05:14,848
No one to leave room.

1174
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:16,416
(knocking at door)

1175
01:05:16,418 --> 01:05:19,051
No, it's the other door.

1176
01:05:21,688 --> 01:05:23,921
It's locked.
I can't open it.

1177
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:26,456
Hurry!
We have 15 seconds.

1178
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:28,891
Move your hand,
chauffeur.

1179
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:34,529
Don't ask me!

1180
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:36,130
Why the butler's
uniform?

1181
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:38,765
I said don't ask me!
I don't know.

1182
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:42,001
It all happened
too quickly.

1183
01:05:42,203 --> 01:05:45,938
The cook.
Where's the cook?

1184
01:05:46,607 --> 01:05:48,340
Gone!
Never said a word.

1185
01:05:48,342 --> 01:05:52,210
Ten more seconds.
Sit and join hands.

1186
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:59,083
Impossible for murder
to happen now without
witnesses.

1187
01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:02,787
Three, two, one!

1188
01:06:02,789 --> 01:06:05,256
(clock chiming)

1189
01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:21,805
(chiming continues)

1190
01:06:29,714 --> 01:06:31,447
(nervous laughter)

1191
01:06:31,449 --> 01:06:32,781
(sighing in relief)

1192
01:06:32,783 --> 01:06:36,651
It's over.
We're safe and sound.

1193
01:06:38,021 --> 01:06:40,421
(knocking at door)

1194
01:06:40,723 --> 01:06:43,223
That's probably
the cook. Come in.

1195
01:06:43,225 --> 01:06:44,224
The woman is deaf.

1196
01:06:44,226 --> 01:06:48,161
I'm sorry, i forgot.
Come in!

1197
01:06:48,563 --> 01:06:51,397
Not sound like
cook to me.

1198
01:07:06,013 --> 01:07:08,480
Ah, mr. Twain!

1199
01:07:08,849 --> 01:07:11,182
You appear
to be wrong.

1200
01:07:11,184 --> 01:07:15,586
Nobody here murdered.
Please come in.

1201
01:07:16,689 --> 01:07:18,822
(all screaming)

1202
01:07:21,526 --> 01:07:22,658
Is he dead?

1203
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:25,227
If he's not,
he should be.

1204
01:07:25,229 --> 01:07:27,429
Touch nothing!
Stop saying "touch nothing."

1205
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:29,864
We're experienced
criminologists.

1206
01:07:29,866 --> 01:07:33,934
It's insulting to
say "touch nothing."

1207
01:07:33,936 --> 01:07:37,203
Be quiet, woman!
Up yours, fellow!

1208
01:07:37,205 --> 01:07:37,770
Most amusing.

1209
01:07:37,772 --> 01:07:41,673
Bickering detectives
like making giant lamb stew.

1210
01:07:41,675 --> 01:07:43,074
Everything go to pot.

1211
01:07:43,076 --> 01:07:45,409
Why don't you
be quiet?

1212
01:07:45,411 --> 01:07:47,077
(all bickering)

1213
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:48,678
(gun fires)

1214
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,446
Quiet!

1215
01:07:50,448 --> 01:07:51,780
Stay where you are,
everybody.

1216
01:07:51,782 --> 01:07:54,349
What?
I'm going to the can.

1217
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:57,285
I don't want
to miss nothing.

1218
01:07:57,287 --> 01:07:59,287
I'm going, too.

1219
01:08:01,024 --> 01:08:03,124
I'd rather
do this alone.

1220
01:08:03,126 --> 01:08:05,059
Thanks anyway.

1221
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:09,963
Dora: The cook.

1222
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:11,697
What, darling?

1223
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:13,832
The cook murdered him.

1224
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:17,535
The butler's dead.
She wasn't in this room.

1225
01:08:17,537 --> 01:08:20,504
No one else
could get out.

1226
01:08:20,506 --> 01:08:21,771
Right?

1227
01:08:21,773 --> 01:08:23,272
Wrong.
Oh?

1228
01:08:23,274 --> 01:08:24,139
What makes you certain?

1229
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:32,013
This arm isn't strong
enough to force a knife
that far up a man's back.

1230
01:08:32,015 --> 01:08:33,014
(all scream)

1231
01:08:33,016 --> 01:08:34,115
Is that the cook's arm?

1232
01:08:34,117 --> 01:08:36,383
It ain't
the pussycat's tail.

1233
01:08:36,385 --> 01:08:36,916
Oh!

1234
01:08:36,918 --> 01:08:40,352
Don't be alarmed.
It ain't real.

1235
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:42,787
Neither is the cook.

1236
01:08:44,123 --> 01:08:47,824
I found this before
i got to the can.

1237
01:08:49,394 --> 01:08:52,495
I have a surprise
for you.

1238
01:08:55,066 --> 01:08:57,199
(all gasp)

1239
01:08:57,334 --> 01:09:00,101
A mannequin.
No, a dummy!

1240
01:09:00,103 --> 01:09:06,307
Perfect in every detail,
except she couldn't hear
or speak.

1241
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:09,977
I congratulate
the murder victim.

1242
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,479
Except for being dead,
he was no dope.

1243
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,346
Nice going, sam.

1244
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:18,351
I hope everyone
realizes someone
in here is a murderer.

1245
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:20,853
For sake of ladies,

1246
01:09:20,855 --> 01:09:23,255
Let's return
to drawing room.

1247
01:09:23,257 --> 01:09:25,323
My son will cover twain.

1248
01:09:25,325 --> 01:09:27,224
Why do i do
the dirty work?

1249
01:09:27,226 --> 01:09:31,294
Because your mother
not here. Come, please.

1250
01:09:46,477 --> 01:09:48,310
Excuse me.

1251
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,316
(thunder rumbling)

1252
01:09:55,318 --> 01:09:56,517
I'm getting
a headache.

1253
01:09:56,519 --> 01:09:59,353
Can't we turn off
that machine?

1254
01:09:59,355 --> 01:10:03,590
Maybe there's
some gadget
outside the window.

1255
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:10,730
Sorry, it's raining
this time.

1256
01:10:10,732 --> 01:10:13,299
Let's sort the facts.

1257
01:10:13,301 --> 01:10:15,801
It's now 12:30 a.M.

1258
01:10:15,803 --> 01:10:18,203
Doors and windows
open at dawn.

1259
01:10:18,205 --> 01:10:21,339
One of us will be
$1 million richer.

1260
01:10:21,341 --> 01:10:24,875
One will go to
the gas chamber
and hang.

1261
01:10:24,877 --> 01:10:27,911
<i>One,  monsieur?
Why not two?</i>

1262
01:10:27,913 --> 01:10:29,178
We all have associates.

1263
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:31,079
Why not four
or six or eight?

1264
01:10:31,081 --> 01:10:32,413
I don't trust
any of you.

1265
01:10:32,415 --> 01:10:37,951
I'm not taking the fall,
you understand?

1266
01:10:37,953 --> 01:10:39,786
Not even for me, sam?

1267
01:10:39,788 --> 01:10:43,523
Why don't you
fall in love
with the jap?

1268
01:10:43,525 --> 01:10:45,958
Get back to case,
please.

1269
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,594
Time is late,
and my eyes are
getting tired.

1270
01:10:49,596 --> 01:10:51,829
I thought they
always looked
like that.

1271
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:52,763
Knock it off, sam!

1272
01:10:52,765 --> 01:10:55,932
This case
is getting
on my nerves.

1273
01:10:55,934 --> 01:10:57,500
I'm sorry, slanty.

1274
01:10:57,502 --> 01:11:01,403
Thank you. Now then,
facts, please.

1275
01:11:01,405 --> 01:11:02,404
Mr. Twain predicts murder.

1276
01:11:02,406 --> 01:11:05,807
Also predicts victim
at dining table.

1277
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:07,809
Correct?
Correct.

1278
01:11:07,811 --> 01:11:10,178
Sorry. This is official.
Correct.

1279
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,847
Also predicts
time of murder

1280
01:11:12,849 --> 01:11:14,882
And number of
stab wounds.

1281
01:11:14,884 --> 01:11:19,052
How can this be unless
he in collaboration
with murderer?

1282
01:11:19,054 --> 01:11:20,853
Maybe twain did it.

1283
01:11:20,855 --> 01:11:22,154
Murdered himself?

1284
01:11:22,156 --> 01:11:26,291
For what possible
reason? And how?

1285
01:11:26,293 --> 01:11:28,493
The motive
is simple. Ego.

1286
01:11:28,495 --> 01:11:30,061
If we couldn't
solve this crime,

1287
01:11:30,063 --> 01:11:33,731
He would be
named the world's
foremost detective.

1288
01:11:33,733 --> 01:11:34,398
With his ego,

1289
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,301
Having to die
for it would seem
a small price.

1290
01:11:38,303 --> 01:11:38,868
As to how,

1291
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:41,737
Any man who can
create these
electronic marvels

1292
01:11:41,739 --> 01:11:47,109
Could devise
a machine to stab
himself in the back.

1293
01:11:47,111 --> 01:11:51,580
Wonderful, darling.
Let's go to bed.

1294
01:11:51,582 --> 01:11:52,380
One moment, please.

1295
01:11:52,382 --> 01:11:55,483
Very interesting theory,
mr. Charleston,

1296
01:11:55,485 --> 01:11:59,887
But you overlook one
very important point.

1297
01:11:59,889 --> 01:12:00,954
What?

1298
01:12:00,956 --> 01:12:01,988
Is stupid.

1299
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:05,057
Is most stupid theory
i ever heard.

1300
01:12:05,059 --> 01:12:05,590
(chuckles)

1301
01:12:05,592 --> 01:12:07,325
Do you have
a better one?

1302
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:07,725
Oh, yes.

1303
01:12:07,727 --> 01:12:12,563
Much better one.
I have been
doing my homework.

1304
01:12:12,565 --> 01:12:15,365
For example,
i have information

1305
01:12:15,367 --> 01:12:17,867
That your wife's
portfolio of stocks

1306
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:21,604
Was seriously
depleted in latest
financial crisis.

1307
01:12:21,606 --> 01:12:23,772
In short,
you are broke,
mr. Charleston.

1308
01:12:23,774 --> 01:12:30,211
You have been borrowing
money at 17% interest
from mr. Lionel twain.

1309
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:31,445
Dickie, is this true?

1310
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:34,748
I was waiting
until your birthday.

1311
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:39,385
$1 million would buy
great many tight suits,

1312
01:12:39,387 --> 01:12:40,619
Would it not,
mr. Charleston?

1313
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:42,687
See here, wang.
Dead broke, dickie?

1314
01:12:42,689 --> 01:12:46,424
Almost, darling.
I have $1.17
and some stamps.

1315
01:12:46,426 --> 01:12:48,292
But i did not
murder lionel twain.

1316
01:12:48,294 --> 01:12:50,127
You believe that,
don't you, darling?

1317
01:12:50,129 --> 01:12:52,729
We'll talk.
We'll see.

1318
01:12:52,731 --> 01:12:54,063
It could have
been any one of you.

1319
01:12:54,065 --> 01:13:01,070
Each of us left
that room, giving
ample opportunity.

1320
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:05,908
As for motives,
there's more than ego
and cash involved.

1321
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:07,476
For example, revenge.

1322
01:13:07,478 --> 01:13:08,543
Meaning what,
mr. Charleston?

1323
01:13:08,545 --> 01:13:13,214
I'm not the only one
who's had experience
with mr. Twain.

1324
01:13:13,216 --> 01:13:16,817
Did you know that
he was once
quite a ladies' man?

1325
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:19,152
Are you suggesting
that someone here...

1326
01:13:19,154 --> 01:13:21,787
Was once in love
with lionel twain.

1327
01:13:21,789 --> 01:13:27,359
He was engaged to
and jilted
miss jessica marbles.

1328
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:30,261
(exclaims in french)

1329
01:13:30,463 --> 01:13:32,529
Jesus h. Christ!

1330
01:13:32,531 --> 01:13:34,831
Jilted 54 years ago
at the altar

1331
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:37,934
In that same
baggy tweed outfit.

1332
01:13:38,436 --> 01:13:41,937
Is this true, jessie?
I was not jilted.

1333
01:13:41,939 --> 01:13:43,438
I walked out on him.

1334
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,441
He wanted to
fool around
before the wedding.

1335
01:13:46,443 --> 01:13:49,610
Being the lady
you are, you refused.

1336
01:13:49,612 --> 01:13:53,513
Not completely.
But it got out of hand.

1337
01:13:53,515 --> 01:13:55,781
He was horrid,
but i didn't kill him.

1338
01:13:55,783 --> 01:13:57,015
That's good enough
for me.

1339
01:13:57,017 --> 01:13:58,416
What do you think,
frenchie?

1340
01:13:58,418 --> 01:14:01,719
I'm not a frenchie.
I'm a belgie.

1341
01:14:02,722 --> 01:14:07,257
As for other motives,
how about patricide?

1342
01:14:07,259 --> 01:14:09,559
Killing one's own parent?

1343
01:14:09,561 --> 01:14:14,497
Lionel twain was
the father of someone
in this room?

1344
01:14:14,565 --> 01:14:17,399
Tess: He wasn't
my father.

1345
01:14:18,335 --> 01:14:20,535
He was my uncle.

1346
01:14:21,404 --> 01:14:22,336
He was very good to me.

1347
01:14:22,338 --> 01:14:26,106
He would take me
to the circus.

1348
01:14:26,108 --> 01:14:30,343
We stopped going
when i was about 26.

1349
01:14:32,947 --> 01:14:33,512
I'm sorry, sam.

1350
01:14:33,514 --> 01:14:37,249
Twenty-six? What the hell
kind of circus?

1351
01:14:37,251 --> 01:14:37,716
Forgive me.

1352
01:14:37,718 --> 01:14:40,719
I was talking
about patricide,
not unclecide.

1353
01:14:40,721 --> 01:14:43,455
<i>Monsieur twain may
have been your uncle,
miss skeffington,</i>

1354
01:14:43,457 --> 01:14:49,527
<i>But he was
the illegitimate father
of  monsieur sidney wang.</i>

1355
01:14:52,465 --> 01:14:54,465
Is not true.

1356
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:55,899
I was adopted.

1357
01:14:55,901 --> 01:14:57,300
I have my papers.

1358
01:14:57,302 --> 01:15:01,804
That's why i adopted
all my children.

1359
01:15:01,806 --> 01:15:03,672
I was wondering.

1360
01:15:03,674 --> 01:15:04,372
Oh...

1361
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,507
He love me
very much,

1362
01:15:06,509 --> 01:15:10,210
But he was not
very observant.

1363
01:15:10,212 --> 01:15:12,845
When i was 19,

1364
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:14,513
He called me
to his study,

1365
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:17,082
Noticed for first time
i was oriental,

1366
01:15:17,084 --> 01:15:19,684
And kicked me
out of house.
I could have...

1367
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:21,719
<i>Killed him,
monsieur wang.</i>

1368
01:15:21,721 --> 01:15:23,420
As easily as you,
mr. Perrier.

1369
01:15:23,422 --> 01:15:28,191
Lionel twain killed
the only thing
you ever loved,

1370
01:15:28,193 --> 01:15:32,161
Marie-louise cartier.

1371
01:15:36,667 --> 01:15:39,067
(whimpering)

1372
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:46,674
Your sweetheart?

1373
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:50,910
My poodle.

1374
01:15:52,146 --> 01:15:54,880
He was a most cruel man.

1375
01:15:55,215 --> 01:16:00,318
<i>Monsieur twain came
to france every season.</i>

1376
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,286
To hunt poodles.

1377
01:16:03,956 --> 01:16:08,024
When they brought me her
bloodied sequined collar,

1378
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:09,191
I vowed i would...

1379
01:16:09,193 --> 01:16:13,261
Knock him off?
Yes. Gladly, if i could.

1380
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:16,263
But i did not.

1381
01:16:16,265 --> 01:16:17,864
Someone here
beat me to it.

1382
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:21,601
So there's more than
one reason we was invited.

1383
01:16:21,603 --> 01:16:25,671
Twain was testing
our skills as detectives,

1384
01:16:25,673 --> 01:16:28,340
And we all have motives
for doing him in.

1385
01:16:28,342 --> 01:16:32,110
Have not yet
heard your motive,
mr. Diamond.

1386
01:16:32,112 --> 01:16:34,579
My motive is unimportant.

1387
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:38,049
Let's just say
i hated him enough
to kill him.

1388
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:40,985
You are closed man,
mr. Diamond.

1389
01:16:40,987 --> 01:16:42,920
You hide many things.

1390
01:16:42,922 --> 01:16:47,224
Could it be that
mr. Twain discover
your secret?

1391
01:16:47,226 --> 01:16:50,227
I don't know
what you're
talking about.

1392
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:54,531
We know different,
do we not,
miss skeffington?

1393
01:16:57,502 --> 01:17:00,002
Twain met sam
in a gay bar.

1394
01:17:00,004 --> 01:17:03,572
I was working on a case.
Working!

1395
01:17:03,574 --> 01:17:06,041
Every night
for six months?

1396
01:17:06,043 --> 01:17:08,109
For 50 bucks a day
and expenses.

1397
01:17:08,111 --> 01:17:10,444
I hate them queeries.

1398
01:17:10,446 --> 01:17:16,183
Twain had
polaroid pictures
of sam in drag.

1399
01:17:16,185 --> 01:17:17,484
I was in disguise.

1400
01:17:17,486 --> 01:17:20,119
Lots of dames
go in those joints.

1401
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:21,220
I never kissed nobody.

1402
01:17:21,222 --> 01:17:25,490
I never did nothing to
a man that i wouldn't
do to a woman.

1403
01:17:25,492 --> 01:17:28,259
And i never killed twain.

1404
01:17:30,963 --> 01:17:32,562
Bitch.

1405
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:34,029
Most interesting.

1406
01:17:34,031 --> 01:17:38,266
All had
perfect motives
for killing twain.

1407
01:17:38,268 --> 01:17:42,336
Wonder which one
was one who done it.

1408
01:17:42,705 --> 01:17:45,706
We still have
the night to
get through.

1409
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:47,607
If anyone is going to
solve this case,

1410
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:49,942
I say we all get
a good night's sleep.

1411
01:17:49,944 --> 01:17:53,078
I suggest we all
lock our doors.

1412
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,914
One of us is
a mad killer,

1413
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:57,982
Not to be trusted.

1414
01:17:57,984 --> 01:18:00,417
(thunder rumbling)

1415
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,786
(door locks)

1416
01:18:39,456 --> 01:18:41,122
Pop?

1417
01:18:41,757 --> 01:18:42,622
Yeah?

1418
01:18:42,624 --> 01:18:45,958
Who do you think
is the murderer?

1419
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,492
Must sleep on it.

1420
01:18:47,494 --> 01:18:51,028
Will know in morning
when wake up.

1421
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:53,697
What if you
don't wake up?

1422
01:18:53,699 --> 01:18:55,899
Then you did it.

1423
01:18:56,134 --> 01:18:58,267
Go sleep, please.

1424
01:18:58,936 --> 01:19:00,368
Good night, dad.

1425
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:03,804
Should have
adopted pussycat.

1426
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:11,177
(hissing)

1427
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:14,246
Should i turn off
the steam, pop?

1428
01:19:14,248 --> 01:19:16,147
(hissing continues)

1429
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:17,615
Not steam.

1430
01:19:17,617 --> 01:19:21,885
Someone just put
deadly snake in room.

1431
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:25,088
Wake me when
it come near bed.

1432
01:19:27,525 --> 01:19:31,927
Dickie, darling,
if you're
the murderer,

1433
01:19:31,929 --> 01:19:33,261
I'll still love you.

1434
01:19:33,263 --> 01:19:35,997
It wouldn't be right
for us to make love,

1435
01:19:35,999 --> 01:19:37,765
But i'd still
love you.

1436
01:19:37,767 --> 01:19:41,702
No fear of that.
Let's see what we have...

1437
01:19:41,704 --> 01:19:45,539
One missing, dead,
naked butler,

1438
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:48,208
One host with
a knife in his back

1439
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:51,477
And one poisonous
scorpion crawling
up our sheets.

1440
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:53,011
Dora: Is that
what that is?

1441
01:19:53,013 --> 01:19:55,046
Yes. They can
kill instantly.

1442
01:19:55,048 --> 01:19:57,748
I suggest
we don't move.

1443
01:19:58,450 --> 01:19:59,782
For how long?

1444
01:19:59,784 --> 01:20:02,985
Possibly the rest
of our lives.

1445
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:11,025
Good heavens!
I know who it is!

1446
01:20:11,027 --> 01:20:12,292
Solvey-poo?

1447
01:20:12,294 --> 01:20:14,160
Yes, miss withers.

1448
01:20:14,162 --> 01:20:16,362
The murderer is...

1449
01:20:16,364 --> 01:20:17,162
Good god! Gas!

1450
01:20:17,164 --> 01:20:20,265
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
I'm old.

1451
01:20:20,267 --> 01:20:23,434
No, the other
kind of gas.

1452
01:20:23,436 --> 01:20:25,402
The kind that kills!

1453
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:26,603
Sometimes my gas...

1454
01:20:26,605 --> 01:20:29,706
It's coming in
through the vent.

1455
01:20:32,711 --> 01:20:34,644
(coughing)

1456
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:42,317
It's locked
from the outside.

1457
01:20:42,419 --> 01:20:42,917
Help!

1458
01:20:42,919 --> 01:20:47,021
It doesn't smell
that bad to me.

1459
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:49,456
Help!

1460
01:21:01,269 --> 01:21:05,904
Did i do right, sam,
telling them about
the gay bar?

1461
01:21:05,972 --> 01:21:06,804
Perfect.

1462
01:21:06,806 --> 01:21:09,606
They took the bait
like a dumb halibut.

1463
01:21:09,608 --> 01:21:11,341
Let them think
i'm a pansy.

1464
01:21:11,343 --> 01:21:12,775
While they're
suspecting me,

1465
01:21:12,777 --> 01:21:16,145
One of them will
let his pants down.

1466
01:21:17,348 --> 01:21:21,483
Sam, why do you keep
naked muscle-man magazines?

1467
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:24,786
Suspects.
Always looking
for suspects.

1468
01:21:24,788 --> 01:21:25,987
(ticking)

1469
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:29,590
What's that
ticking sound
i hear?

1470
01:21:36,732 --> 01:21:39,332
"it is a bomb
in your room

1471
01:21:39,334 --> 01:21:42,568
"that will go off
in 30 seconds."
signed, "the murderer."

1472
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:43,802
Quick, sam, the door!

1473
01:21:43,804 --> 01:21:46,638
"p.S. The door
is locked."

1474
01:21:53,213 --> 01:21:55,846
I'm sorry about this,
tess.

1475
01:21:55,848 --> 01:21:58,081
And me owing you
all that money, too.

1476
01:21:58,083 --> 01:21:59,949
That's okay.
What can we do?

1477
01:21:59,951 --> 01:22:04,954
I got an idea.
I don't know whether
this will work.

1478
01:22:04,956 --> 01:22:07,189
Quick! Turn around!
I'm turned, sam.

1479
01:22:07,191 --> 01:22:09,257
Whatever happens,
don't turn back.

1480
01:22:09,259 --> 01:22:10,157
But, sam, if anything...

1481
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,125
Do as i say!
I will, sam.

1482
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:16,262
Good, because i think
i'm gonna cry.

1483
01:22:16,597 --> 01:22:18,830
(sam sobbing)

1484
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:26,203
(humming)

1485
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,076
What are you
doing here?

1486
01:22:33,078 --> 01:22:34,877
There's no place
else to sleep.

1487
01:22:34,879 --> 01:22:37,779
Sleep in the car,
you chauffeur.
Go, go!

1488
01:22:37,781 --> 01:22:38,713
You aren't fair.

1489
01:22:38,715 --> 01:22:41,115
I will tell everyone
about your toupee.

1490
01:22:41,117 --> 01:22:42,349
They already know.

1491
01:22:42,351 --> 01:22:43,950
Then why wear it?

1492
01:22:43,952 --> 01:22:46,018
I didn't know
you knew.

1493
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:48,186
Certainly i know.

1494
01:22:48,188 --> 01:22:50,721
It's a terrible toupee.

1495
01:22:50,989 --> 01:22:52,655
(explosion)

1496
01:22:52,657 --> 01:22:54,657
A bomb across the hall!

1497
01:22:54,659 --> 01:22:57,426
Quickly.
The door! The door!

1498
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,566
It's locked
from the outside.

1499
01:23:05,568 --> 01:23:09,369
You look taller to me.
Why is that?

1500
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:12,105
I don't understand.
I'm not getting taller.

1501
01:23:12,107 --> 01:23:14,073
If you aren't
getting taller,

1502
01:23:14,075 --> 01:23:16,075
There is only
one alternative.

1503
01:23:16,077 --> 01:23:19,311
The room is
getting shorter.

1504
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:20,978
(exclaims in french)

1505
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:23,847
The ceiling is coming down!

1506
01:23:24,382 --> 01:23:26,415
(shrieking)

1507
01:23:33,223 --> 01:23:35,556
What will we do?
I don't know.

1508
01:23:35,558 --> 01:23:40,427
But this is
how they make
goose liver pate.

1509
01:23:40,429 --> 01:23:43,296
(screaming)

1510
01:24:12,393 --> 01:24:14,593
Not so fast, please.

1511
01:24:14,595 --> 01:24:16,995
Do not cross out
wang name.

1512
01:24:16,997 --> 01:24:20,765
Cross out snake
instead.

1513
01:24:20,933 --> 01:24:22,232
Nice shot, pop.

1514
01:24:22,234 --> 01:24:25,802
Sure wish i weren't
such a heavy sleeper.

1515
01:24:25,804 --> 01:24:27,570
And now,

1516
01:24:28,472 --> 01:24:30,472
If you please,

1517
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:35,643
$1 million,
mr. Bensonmum.

1518
01:24:35,745 --> 01:24:37,845
Banzai, pop!

1519
01:24:38,314 --> 01:24:40,781
Very clever of you,
mr. Wang.

1520
01:24:40,783 --> 01:24:45,385
Oh, yes.
As you can see,
i can see.

1521
01:24:46,054 --> 01:24:47,353
So i see.

1522
01:24:47,355 --> 01:24:52,324
Tell me, how did you
deduce it was me?

1523
01:24:52,326 --> 01:24:57,062
Went back to theory
seldom used today.

1524
01:24:58,298 --> 01:25:00,331
Butler did it.

1525
01:25:00,599 --> 01:25:02,532
I hadn't thought of that.

1526
01:25:02,534 --> 01:25:06,435
How do you account for
my body in the kitchen?

1527
01:25:06,437 --> 01:25:10,806
Body made of plastic,
same as plastic cook.

1528
01:25:10,808 --> 01:25:14,476
While we examine
plastic butler,

1529
01:25:14,478 --> 01:25:17,178
You murder lionel twain.

1530
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:20,514
You're a clever little
laundryman, mr. Wang.

1531
01:25:20,516 --> 01:25:22,782
But not quite
clever enough!

1532
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:26,185
I'll take
that $1 million,

1533
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:30,756
Bensonmum,
alias irving goldman.

1534
01:25:32,259 --> 01:25:33,491
Irving goldman?

1535
01:25:33,493 --> 01:25:39,830
Yes. Irving goldman
was the attorney of
the late lionel twain.

1536
01:25:39,832 --> 01:25:41,531
Lionel twain died
five years ago.

1537
01:25:41,533 --> 01:25:46,168
His body was recently found
in goldman's filing cabinet.

1538
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:49,338
Am i correct,
mr. Goldman?

1539
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:52,708
Yeah. Correct,
miss marbles.

1540
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,977
But how did you
escape the poison gas?

1541
01:25:55,979 --> 01:25:57,945
Quite simple.
I covered my mouth

1542
01:25:57,947 --> 01:26:01,915
And let miss withers
breathe in the gas.

1543
01:26:02,851 --> 01:26:03,983
Sicky-poo.

1544
01:26:03,985 --> 01:26:05,351
Yes, dear, i know.

1545
01:26:05,353 --> 01:26:07,252
The million dollars,
please.

1546
01:26:07,254 --> 01:26:11,256
I wouldn't, goldman.
Or is it goldman?

1547
01:26:11,258 --> 01:26:14,926
Actually, it's
mr. Marvin metzler.

1548
01:26:16,262 --> 01:26:18,729
Marvin metzler?

1549
01:26:19,064 --> 01:26:21,831
Very good, mr. Charleston,

1550
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:24,433
But how did you know?

1551
01:26:24,435 --> 01:26:26,935
The bill in the
dead butler's hand

1552
01:26:26,937 --> 01:26:29,704
Said the entire
weekend was catered.

1553
01:26:29,706 --> 01:26:31,839
Only an accountant
would save that.

1554
01:26:31,841 --> 01:26:34,508
Get the money.
Let's go.
In a moment, darling.

1555
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:37,077
Goldman died last month
while skiing.

1556
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:40,513
He jumped 200 feet
into a low-flying plane.

1557
01:26:40,515 --> 01:26:41,614
I can't wait much longer.

1558
01:26:41,616 --> 01:26:45,751
You've not
lost your touch,
mr. Charleston,

1559
01:26:45,753 --> 01:26:49,121
But how did you elude
the deadly scorpion?

1560
01:26:49,123 --> 01:26:51,523
We didn't.
He stung dora.

1561
01:26:51,525 --> 01:26:52,824
We've 15 minutes
to get help.

1562
01:26:52,826 --> 01:26:56,761
Explain later, dickie.
We'll make it, darling.
Never fear.

1563
01:26:56,763 --> 01:26:57,628
The money,
mr. Metzler?

1564
01:26:57,630 --> 01:26:59,863
<i>Perrier: Belongs to me,
monsieur!</i>

1565
01:26:59,865 --> 01:27:03,433
Marcel is one
of the world's
strongest men.

1566
01:27:03,435 --> 01:27:08,404
He stopped your ceiling
from crushing us
at 4'5".

1567
01:27:08,406 --> 01:27:12,674
It may be months before
we straighten up again,

1568
01:27:12,676 --> 01:27:17,745
But $1 million will buy
a lot of back braces.

1569
01:27:19,482 --> 01:27:22,182
Right, miss irene twain,

1570
01:27:22,184 --> 01:27:24,551
Daughter of lionel?

1571
01:27:24,686 --> 01:27:26,085
What?

1572
01:27:26,987 --> 01:27:30,121
I prefer to
be called rita.

1573
01:27:32,859 --> 01:27:33,557
How did you know?

1574
01:27:33,559 --> 01:27:38,028
Never underestimate
a frenchman's nostrils,
miss twain.

1575
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:42,999
At dinner tonight,
i smelled your
chanel no. 5.

1576
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:45,768
It was you
who did away
with all of them!

1577
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:49,638
Metzler, goldman
and your father.

1578
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,373
In fact,
if you had your way,

1579
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:53,875
You'd like to do
away with all men,

1580
01:27:53,877 --> 01:27:55,142
Wouldn't you,
miss twain?

1581
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:58,645
Men have
made you ashamed
and made you suffer

1582
01:27:58,647 --> 01:28:02,548
Because you were
born with brains,
talent, money,

1583
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:06,552
Everything but what
you most desired,

1584
01:28:06,554 --> 01:28:08,153
Beauty.

1585
01:28:08,155 --> 01:28:12,991
Miss twain, as a man,
you are barely passable,

1586
01:28:12,993 --> 01:28:15,026
But as a woman,

1587
01:28:15,028 --> 01:28:16,894
You are a dog.

1588
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:20,764
That's your opinion,
big boy.

1589
01:28:22,434 --> 01:28:23,800
And now my money,
please.

1590
01:28:23,802 --> 01:28:29,305
With luck, i can still
arrive at maxim's
in time for dinner.

1591
01:28:29,307 --> 01:28:31,907
Sam: Just order
a tuna sandwich!

1592
01:28:31,909 --> 01:28:34,209
That dough
belongs to me.

1593
01:28:34,211 --> 01:28:35,743
I'm alive
and kicking.

1594
01:28:35,745 --> 01:28:38,645
Miss skeffington
dropped your bomb
down the toilet.

1595
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,947
It exploded
as she flushed.

1596
01:28:40,949 --> 01:28:43,582
The seat barely
missed her head.

1597
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:45,116
(coughing)

1598
01:28:45,118 --> 01:28:47,551
I'm all right, j.J.

1599
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,452
J.J.?

1600
01:28:51,722 --> 01:28:55,757
That's right, folks.
He outsmarted us all.

1601
01:28:55,892 --> 01:29:00,261
The real sam diamond
is behind that desk.

1602
01:29:00,263 --> 01:29:03,897
My name is loomis,
j.J. Loomis.
I'm an actor.

1603
01:29:03,899 --> 01:29:05,331
I do impressions.

1604
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:08,967
I've done the carson show
six times.

1605
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:11,569
Diamond hired me
for the weekend.

1606
01:29:11,571 --> 01:29:13,871
Miss skeffington
is vilma norman,

1607
01:29:13,873 --> 01:29:17,841
A cocktail waitress
at the waterbed motel.

1608
01:29:17,976 --> 01:29:20,009
Hi.
Hello.

1609
01:29:20,011 --> 01:29:23,212
Diamond hated all of you.
You all earned big money.

1610
01:29:23,214 --> 01:29:26,481
Diamond had that crummy
san francisco office.

1611
01:29:26,483 --> 01:29:30,551
If he proved he was best,
he'd get your rich clients.

1612
01:29:30,553 --> 01:29:34,087
But since i figured it out,

1613
01:29:34,355 --> 01:29:38,824
I figure that money
belongs to me.

1614
01:29:39,293 --> 01:29:42,661
Isn't that right,
mr. Diamond?

1615
01:29:44,998 --> 01:29:46,530
Wrong.

1616
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:50,199
That would have
been too obvious.

1617
01:29:50,201 --> 01:29:53,368
My dear colleagues,
what you all seem
to overlook

1618
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:56,604
Is the most
simple solution.

1619
01:29:57,006 --> 01:29:58,872
I am indeed

1620
01:29:58,874 --> 01:30:00,907
Lionel twain.

1621
01:30:01,576 --> 01:30:03,542
(all gasp)

1622
01:30:03,844 --> 01:30:08,313
You've all been
so clever for so long,

1623
01:30:08,315 --> 01:30:10,481
You've forgotten
to be humble.

1624
01:30:10,483 --> 01:30:13,750
You've tricked and
fooled your readers
for years.

1625
01:30:13,752 --> 01:30:17,787
You've tortured us
with surprise endings
that made no sense.

1626
01:30:17,789 --> 01:30:20,990
You've introduced
characters in
the last chapter

1627
01:30:20,992 --> 01:30:23,859
That weren't in
the book before.

1628
01:30:23,861 --> 01:30:27,262
You've left out clues
and information

1629
01:30:27,264 --> 01:30:31,332
That we needed to
guess who did it.

1630
01:30:31,334 --> 01:30:35,536
But now the tables
are turned.

1631
01:30:35,604 --> 01:30:39,339
Millions of angry
mystery readers

1632
01:30:39,341 --> 01:30:42,508
Are now getting
their revenge.

1633
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:45,777
When the world learns
i've outsmarted you,

1634
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:50,515
They'll be selling your
$1.95 books for 12 cents.

1635
01:30:50,517 --> 01:30:53,985
It's check-out time,
ladies and gentlemen.

1636
01:30:53,987 --> 01:30:56,754
I have your bills ready.

1637
01:30:57,490 --> 01:31:00,724
Credit cards
will be accepted.

1638
01:31:21,146 --> 01:31:23,412
The scorpion
was a fake?

1639
01:31:23,414 --> 01:31:25,347
Everything.
The bridge,
the maid.

1640
01:31:25,349 --> 01:31:28,149
You're sure
about the scorpion?

1641
01:31:28,151 --> 01:31:30,351
Positive.
Even the fog.

1642
01:31:30,353 --> 01:31:33,587
He made the fog
with dry ice. Look.

1643
01:31:33,589 --> 01:31:36,122
How awfully
unromantic!

1644
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,396
If he was
lionel twain,

1645
01:31:44,398 --> 01:31:47,766
You must really
be sam diamond.

1646
01:31:48,235 --> 01:31:49,067
Right.

1647
01:31:49,069 --> 01:31:52,236
I was in disguise,
in disguise, in disguise.

1648
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:55,272
You work hard
in this racket.

1649
01:31:55,274 --> 01:31:58,341
Will we be seeing
each other again?

1650
01:31:58,343 --> 01:32:02,912
Well, that depends.
I'll be around
if you need me.

1651
01:32:03,147 --> 01:32:06,281
All you got to
do is whistle.

1652
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:09,383
You do know
how to whistle?

1653
01:32:09,385 --> 01:32:11,218
Certainly.
What do you mean?

1654
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:15,055
Never mind.
You ruined it.

1655
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,894
I don't understand.
Was there a murder?

1656
01:32:21,896 --> 01:32:24,630
Yes. Killed good weekend.

1657
01:32:24,632 --> 01:32:26,531
Drive, please.

1658
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:04,435
(laughing)
